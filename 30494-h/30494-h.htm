ADVENTURE THE FIRST</div>

<div class='title'>BROWNIE AND THE COOK</div><br /><br />
</td>
</tr></table></div>

<div class='cap'>THERE was once a little Brownie, who lived&mdash;where do you
think he lived? in a coal-cellar.</div>

<p>Now a coal-cellar may seem a most curious place to choose to live
in; but then a Brownie is a curious creature&mdash;a fairy, and yet not
one of that sort of fairies who fly about on gossamer wings, and
dance in the moonlight, and so on. He never dances; and as to
wings, what use would they be to him in a coal-cellar? He is a sober,
stay-at-home, household elf&mdash;nothing much to look at, even if you
did see him, which you are not likely to do&mdash;only a little old man,
about a foot high, all dressed in brown, with a brown face and hands,
and a brown peaked cap, just the color of a brown mouse. And,
like a mouse, he hides in corners&mdash;especially kitchen corners, and
only comes out after dark when nobody is about, and so sometimes
people call him Mr. Nobody.</p>

<p>I said you were not likely to see him. I never did, certainly, and
never knew any body that did; but still, if you were to go into Devonshire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
you would hear many funny stories about Brownies in general,
and so I may as well tell you the adventures of this particular Brownie,
who belonged to a family there; which family he had followed from
house to house, most faithfully, for years and years.</p>

<p>A good many people had heard him&mdash;or supposed they had&mdash;when
there were extraordinary noises about the house; noises which
must have come from a mouse or a rat&mdash;or a Brownie. But nobody
had ever seen him except the children&mdash;the three little boys and
three little girls&mdash;who declared he often came to play with them when
they were alone, and was the nicest companion in the world, though
he was such an old man&mdash;hundreds of years old! He was full of fun
and mischief, and up to all sorts of tricks, but he never did any body
any harm unless they deserved it.</p>

<p>Brownie was supposed to live under one particular coal, in the
darkest corner of the cellar, which was never allowed to be disturbed.
Why he had chosen it nobody knew, and how he lived there, nobody
knew either, nor what he lived upon. Except that, ever since the
family could remember, there had always been a bowl of milk put
behind the coal-cellar door for the Brownie's supper. Perhaps he
drank it&mdash;perhaps he didn't: anyhow, the bowl was always found
empty next morning. The old Cook, who had lived all her life in
the family, had never forgotten to give Brownie his supper; but at
last she died, and a young cook came in her stead, who was very
apt to forget every thing. She was also both careless and lazy, and
disliked taking the trouble to put a bowl of milk in the same place
every night for Mr. Nobody. "She didn't believe in Brownies,"
she said; "she had never seen one, and seeing's believing." So she
laughed at the other servants, who looked very grave, and put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
bowl of milk in its place as often as they could, without saying much
about it.</p>

<p>But once, when Brownie woke up, at his usual hour for rising&mdash;ten
o'clock at night, and looked round in search of his supper&mdash;which
was, in fact, his breakfast&mdash;he found nothing there. At first
he could not imagine such neglect, and went smelling and smelling
about for his bowl of milk&mdash;it was not always placed in the same
corner now&mdash;but in vain.</p>

<p>"This will never do," said he; and being extremely hungry, began
running about the coal-cellar to see what he could find. His eyes
were as useful in the dark as in the light&mdash;like a pussy-cat's; but
there was nothing to be seen&mdash;not even a potato paring, or a dry
crust, or a well-gnawed bone, such as Tiny the terrier sometimes
brought into the coal-cellar and left on the floor&mdash;nothing, in short,
but heaps of coals and coal-dust; and even a Brownie cannot eat
that, you know.</p>

<p>"Can't stand this; quite impossible!" said the Brownie, tightening
his belt to make his poor little inside feel less empty. He had been
asleep so long&mdash;about a week, I believe, as was his habit when there
was nothing to do&mdash;that he seemed ready to eat his own head, or his
boots, or any thing. 'What's to be done? Since nobody brings
my supper, I must go and fetch it.'</p>

<p>He spoke quickly, for he always thought quickly, and made up
his mind in a minute. To be sure it was a very little mind,
like his little body; but he did the best he could with it, and
was not a bad sort of old fellow, after all. In the house he had
never done any harm, and often some good, for he frightened away
all the rats, mice, and black-beetles. Not the crickets&mdash;he liked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
them, as the old Cook had done: she said they were such cheerful
creatures, and always brought luck to the house. But the young
Cook could not bear them, and used to pour boiling water down their
holes, and set basins of beer for them with little wooden bridges up
to the brim, that they might walk up, tumble in, and be drowned.</p>

<p>So there was not even a cricket singing in the silent house when
Brownie put his head out of his coal-cellar door, which, to his surprise,
he found open. Old Cook used to lock it every night, but the
young Cook had left that key, and the kitchen and pantry keys too,
all dangling in the lock, so that any thief might have got in, and
wandered all over the house without being found out.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, here's luck!" cried Brownie, tossing his cap up in the
air, and bounding right through the scullery into the kitchen. It
was quite empty, but there was a good fire burning itself out&mdash;just
for its own amusement, and the remains of a capital supper spread
on the table&mdash;enough for half a dozen people being left still.</p>

<p>Would you like to know what there was? Devonshire cream, of
course; and part of a large dish of junket, which is something like
curds and whey. Lots of bread-and-butter and cheese, and half
an apple-pudding. Also a great jug of cider and another of milk, and
several half-full glasses, and no end of dirty plates, knives, and forks.
All were scattered about the table in the most untidy fashion, just
as the servants had risen from their supper, without thinking to put
any thing away.</p>

<p>Brownie screwed up his little old face and turned up his button
of a nose, and gave a long whistle. You might not believe it, seeing
he lived in a coal-cellar; but really he liked <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tidiness,and'">tidiness, and</ins> always played
his pranks upon disorderly or slovenly folk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="347" height="500" alt="He wanted his supper, and oh! what a supper he did eat!&mdash;Page 11" title="" />
<span class="caption">He wanted his supper, and oh! what a supper he did eat!&mdash;Page 11</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whew!" said he; "here's a chance. What a supper I'll get
now!"</p>

<p>And he jumped on to a chair and thence to the table, but so quietly
that the large black cat with four white paws, called Muff, because
she was so fat and soft and her fur so long, who sat dozing in front
of the fire, just opened one eye and went to sleep again. She had
tried to get her nose into the milk-jug, but it was too small; and the
junket-dish was too deep for her to reach, except with one paw. She
didn't care much for bread and cheese and apple-pudding, and was
very well fed besides; so, after just wandering round the table, she
had jumped down from it again, and settled herself to sleep on the
hearth.</p>

<p>But Brownie had no notion of going to sleep. He wanted his
supper, and oh! what a supper he did eat! first one thing and then
another, and then trying every thing all over again. And oh! what
a lot he drank&mdash;first milk and then cider, and then mixed the two
together in a way that would have disagreed with any body except
a Brownie. As it was, he was obliged to slacken his belt several
times, and at last took it off altogether. But he must have had a most
extraordinary capacity for eating and drinking&mdash;since, after he had
nearly cleared the table, he was just as lively as if he had had no
supper at all.</p>

<p>Now his jumping was a little awkward, for there happened to be
a clean white tablecloth: as this was only Monday, it had had no
time to get dirty&mdash;untidy as the Cook was. And you know Brownie
lived in a coal-cellar, and his feet were black with running about in
coal dust. So wherever he trod, he left the impression behind, until
at last the whole tablecloth was covered with black marks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Not that he minded this; in fact, he took great pains to make the
cloth as dirty as possible; and then laughing loudly, "Ho, ho, ho!"
leaped on to the hearth, and began teasing the cat; squeaking like a
mouse, or chirping like a cricket, or buzzing like a fly; and altogether
disturbing poor Pussy's mind so much, that she went and hid herself
in the farthest corner, and left him the hearth all to himself, where
he lay at ease till daybreak.</p>

<p>Then, hearing a slight noise overhead, which might be the servants
getting up, he jumped on to the table <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'agan'">again</ins>&mdash;gobbled up the
few remaining crumbs for his breakfast, and scampered off to his
coal-cellar; where he hid himself under his big coal, and fell asleep
for the day.</p>

<p>Well, the Cook came downstairs rather earlier than usual, for she
remembered she had to clear off the remains of supper; but lo and
behold, there was nothing left to clear. Every bit of food was eaten
up&mdash;the cheese looked as if a dozen mice had been nibbling at it,
and nibbled it down to the very rind; the milk and cider were all
drunk&mdash;and mice don't care for milk and cider, you know. As for
the apple-pudding, it had vanished altogether; and the dish was
licked as clean as if Boxer, the yard-dog, had been at it in his hungriest
mood.</p>

<p>"And my white table-cloth&mdash;oh, my clean white table-cloth!
What can have been done to it?" cried she, in amazement. For it
was all over little black footmarks, just the size of a baby's foot&mdash;only
babies don't wear shoes with nails in them, and don't run about
and climb on kitchen tables after all the family have gone to bed.</p>

<p>Cook was a little frightened; but her fright changed to anger when
she saw the large black cat stretched comfortably on the hearth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Poor Muff had crept there for a little snooze after Brownie went
away.</p>

<p>"You nasty cat! I see it all now; it's you that have eaten up all
the supper; it's you that have been on my clean table-cloth with
your dirty paws."</p>

<span class="caption">Cook beat poor Pussy till the creature ran mewing away</span>
</div>

<p>They were white paws, and as
clean as possible; but the Cook
never thought of that, any more
than she did of the fact that cats
don't usually drink cider or eat
apple-pudding.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you to come stealing
food in this way; take that&mdash;and
that&mdash;and that!"</p>

<p>Cook got hold of a broom and
beat poor Pussy till the creature
ran mewing away. She couldn't
speak, you know&mdash;unfortunate
cat! and tell people that it was
Brownie who had done it all.</p>

<p>Next night Cook thought she
would make all safe and sure; so,
instead of letting the cat sleep by
the fire, she shut her up in the chilly coal-cellar, locked the door,
put the key in her pocket, and went off to bed&mdash;leaving the
supper as before.</p>

<p>When Brownie woke up and looked out of his hole, there was, as
usual, no supper for him, and the cellar was close shut. He peered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
about, to try and find some cranny under the door to creep out at,
but there was none. And he felt so hungry that he could almost
have eaten the cat, who kept walking to and fro in a melancholy
manner&mdash;only she was alive, and he couldn't well eat her alive:
besides, he knew she was old, and had an idea she might be tough;
so he merely said, politely, "How do you do, Mrs. Pussy?" to which
she answered nothing&mdash;of course.</p>

<p>Something must be done, and luckily Brownies can do things
which nobody else can do. So he thought he would change himself
into a mouse, and gnaw a hole through the door. But then he suddenly
remembered the cat, who, though he had decided not to eat
her, might take this opportunity of eating him. So he thought it
advisable to wait till she was fast asleep, which did not happen for
a good while. At length, quite tired with walking about, Pussy
turned round on her tail six times, curled down in a corner, and fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Immediately Brownie changed himself into the smallest mouse
possible; and, taking care not to make the least noise, gnawed a
hole in the door, and squeezed himself through, immediately turning
into his proper shape again, for fear of accidents.</p>

<p>The kitchen fire was at its last glimmer; but it showed a better
supper than even last night, for the Cook had had friends with her&mdash;a
brother and two cousins&mdash;and they had been exceedingly merry.
The food they had left behind was enough for three Brownies at
least, but this one managed to eat it all up. Only once, in trying to
cut a great slice of beef, he let the carving-knife and fork fall with
such a clatter, that Tiny the terrier, who was tied up at the foot of
the stairs, began to bark furiously. However, he brought her her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
puppy, which had been left in a basket in a corner of the kitchen, and
so succeeded in quieting her.</p>

<p>After that he enjoyed himself amazingly, and made more marks
than ever on the white table-cloth; for he began jumping about like
a pea on a trencher, in order to make his particularly large supper
agree with him.</p>

<p>Then, in the absence of the cat, he teased the puppy for an hour or
two, till hearing the clock strike five, he thought it as well to turn into
a mouse again, and creep back cautiously into his cellar. He was
only just in time, for Muff opened one eye, and was just going to
pounce upon him, when he changed himself back into a Brownie.
She was so startled that she bounded away, her tail growing into
twice its natural size, and her eyes gleaming like round green globes.
But Brownie only said, "Ha, ha, ho!" and walked deliberately into
his hole.</p>

<p>When Cook came downstairs and saw that the same thing had
happened again&mdash;that the supper was all eaten, and the table-cloth
blacker than ever with the extraordinary footmarks, she was greatly
puzzled. Who could have done it all? Not the cat, who came mewing
out of the coal-cellar the minute she unlocked the door. Possibly
a rat&mdash;but then would a rat have come within reach of Tiny?</p>

<p>"It must have been Tiny herself, or her puppy," which just came
rolling out of its basket over Cook's feet. "You little wretch! You
and your mother are the greatest nuisance imaginable. I'll punish
you!"</p>

<p>And, quite forgetting that Tiny had been safely tied up all night,
and that her poor little puppy was so fat and helpless it could scarcely
stand on its legs, to say nothing of jumping on chairs and tables,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
she gave them both such a thrashing that they ran howling together
out of the kitchen door, where the kind little kitchen-maid took
them up in her arms.</p>

<p>"You ought to have beaten the Brownie, if you could catch him,"
said she, in a whisper. "He will do it again and again, you'll see,
for he can't bear an untidy kitchen. You'd better do as poor old
Cook did, and clear the supper things away, and put the odds and
ends safe in the larder; also," she added, mysteriously, "if I were
you, I'd put a bowl of milk behind the coal-cellar door."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" answered the young Cook, and flounced away.
But afterward she thought better of it, and did as she was advised,
grumbling all the time, but doing it.</p>

<p>Next morning the milk was gone! Perhaps Brownie had drunk
it up, anyhow nobody could say that he hadn't. As for the supper,
Cook having safely laid it on the shelves of the larder, nobody touched
it. And the table-cloth, which was wrapped up tidily and put in the
dresser drawer, came out as clean as ever, with not a single black
footmark upon it. No mischief being done, the cat and the dog
both escaped beating, and Brownie played no more tricks with
any body&mdash;till the next time.</p>

<div class='title'>BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
</td>
</tr></table></div>



<div class='cap'>THE "next time" was quick in
coming, which was not wonderful,
considering there was a Brownie in the house. Otherwise the
house was like most other houses, and the family like most other
families. The children also: they were sometimes good, sometimes
naughty, like other children; but, on the whole, they deserved to
have the pleasure of a Brownie to play with them, as they declared
he did&mdash;many and many a time.</div>

<p>A favorite play-place was the orchard, where grew the biggest
cherry-tree you ever saw. They called it their "castle," because
it rose up ten feet from the ground in one thick stem, and then branched
out into a circle of boughs, with a flat place in the middle, where two
or three children could sit at once. There they often did sit, turn
by turn, or one at a time&mdash;sometimes with a book, reading; and the
biggest boy made a sort of rope-ladder by which they could climb up
and down&mdash;which they did all winter, and enjoyed their "castle"
very much.</p>

<p>But one day in spring they found their ladder cut away! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Gardener had done it, saying it injured the tree, which was just
coming into blossom. Now this Gardener was a rather gruff man,
with a growling voice. He did not mean to be unkind, but he disliked
children; he said they bothered him. But when they complained
to their mother about the ladder, she agreed with Gardener
that the tree must not be injured, as it bore the biggest cherries in
all the neighborhood&mdash;so big that the old saying of "taking two
bites at a cherry," came really true.</p>

<p>"Wait till the cherries are ripe," said she; and so the little people
waited, and watched it through its leafing and blossoming&mdash;such
sheets of blossom, white as snow!&mdash;till the fruit began to show, and
grew large and red on every bough.</p>

<p>At last one morning the mother said, "Children, should you like
to help gather the cherries to-day?"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" they cried, "and not a day too soon; for we saw a
flock of starlings in the next field&mdash;and if we don't clear the tree,
they will."</p>

<p>"Very well; clear it, then. Only mind and fill my basket quite
full, for preserving. What is over you may eat, if you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you!" and the children were eager to be off;
but the mother stopped them till she could get the Gardener and
his ladder.</p>

<p>"For it is he must climb the tree, not you; and you must do exactly
as he tells you; and he will stop with you all the time and see that
you don't come to harm."</p>

<p>This was no slight cloud on the children's happiness, and they
begged hard to go alone.</p>

<p>"Please, might we? We will be so good!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">When the Gardener was steadying his ladder against the trunk of the cherry-tree</span>
</div>

<p>The mother shook her head. All the goodness in the world would
not help them if they tumbled off the tree, or ate themselves sick with
cherries. "You would not be safe, and I should be so unhappy!"</p>

<p>To make mother "unhappy" was the worst rebuke possible to
these children; so they choked down their disappointment, and
followed the Gardener as he walked on ahead, carrying his ladder
on his shoulder. He looked very cross, and as if he did not like the
children's company at all.</p>

<p>They were pretty good, on the whole, though they chattered
a good deal; but Gardener said not a word to them all the way to
the orchard. When they reached it, he just told them to "keep out
of his way and not worrit him," which they politely promised, saying
among themselves that they should not enjoy their cherry-gathering
at all. But children who make the best of things, and
try to be as good as they can, sometimes have fun unawares.</p>

<p>When the Gardener was steadying his ladder against the trunk
of the cherry-tree, there was suddenly heard the barking of a dog,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and a very fierce dog, too. First it seemed close beside them, then
in the flower-garden, then in the fowl-yard.</p>

<p>Gardener dropped the ladder out of his hands. "It's that Boxer!
He has got loose again! He will be running after my chickens,
and dragging his broken chain all over my borders. And he is so
fierce, and so delighted to get free. He'll bite any body who ties
him up, except me."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better you go and see after him?"</p>

<p>Gardener thought it was the eldest boy who spoke, and turned
round angrily; but the little fellow had never opened his lips.</p>

<p>Here there was heard a still louder bark, and from a quite different
part of the garden.</p>

<p>"There he is&mdash;I'm sure of it! jumping over my bedding-out
plants, and breaking my cucumber frames. Abominable beast!&mdash;just
let me catch him!" Off Gardener darted in a violent passion,
throwing the ladder down upon the grass, and forgetting all about
the cherries and the children.</p>

<p>The instant he was gone, a shrill laugh, loud and merry, was heard
close by, and a little brown old man's face peeped from behind the
cherry-tree.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do?&mdash;Boxer was me. Didn't I bark well? Now
I'm come to play with you."</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands; for they knew they were going
to have some fun if Brownie was there&mdash;he was the best little playfellow
in the world. And then they had him all to themselves.
Nobody ever saw him except the children.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried he, in his shrill voice, half like an old man's,
half like a baby's. "Who'll begin to gather the cherries?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 414px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>They all looked blank; for the tree was so high to where the
branches sprang, and besides, their mother had said they were not
to climb. And the ladder lay flat upon the grass&mdash;far too heavy
for little hands to move.</p>

<p>"What! you big boys don't expect a poor little fellow like me to
lift the ladder all by myself? Try! I'll help you."</p>

<p>Whether he helped or not, no sooner had they taken hold of the
ladder than it rose up, almost of its own accord, and fixed itself quite
safely against the tree.</p>

<p>"But we must not climb&mdash;mother told us not," said the boys,
ruefully. "Mother said we were to stand at the bottom and pick
up the cherries."</p>

<p>"Very well. Obey your mother. I'll just run up the tree myself."</p>

<p>Before the words were out of his mouth Brownie darted up the
ladder like a monkey, and disappeared among the fruit-laden branches.</p>

<p>The children looked dismayed for a minute, till they saw a merry
brown face peeping out from the green leaves at the very top of
the tree.</p>

<p>"Biggest fruit always grows highest," cried the Brownie. "Stand
in a row, all you children. Little boys, hold out your caps: little
girls, make a bag of your pinafores. Open your mouths and shut
your eyes, and see what the queen will send you."</p>

<p>They laughed and did as they were told; whereupon they were
drowned in a shower of cherries&mdash;cherries falling like hailstones,
hitting them on their heads, their cheeks, their noses&mdash;filling their
caps and pinafores, and then rolling and tumbling on to the grass,
till it was strewn thick as leaves in autumn with the rosy fruit.</p>

<p>What a glorious scramble they had&mdash;these three little boys and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
three little girls! How they laughed and jumped and knocked
their heads together in picking up the cherries, yet never quarreled&mdash;for
there were such heaps, it would have been ridiculous to squabble
over them; and besides, whenever they began to quarrel, Brownie
always ran away. Now he was the merriest of the lot; ran up and
down the tree like a cat, helped to pick up the cherries, and was
first-rate at filling the large market-basket.</p>

<p>"We were to eat as many as we liked, only we must first fill the
basket," conscientiously said the eldest girl; upon which they all set
to at once, and filled it to the brim.</p>

<p>"Now we'll have a dinner-party," cried the Brownie; and squatted
down like a Turk, crossed his queer little legs, and sticking his
elbows upon his knees, in a way that nobody but a Brownie could manage.
"Sit in a ring! sit in a ring! and we'll see who can eat fastest."</p>

<p>The children obeyed. How many cherries they devoured, and
how fast they did it, passes my capacity of telling. I only hope they
were not ill next day, and that all the cherry-stones they swallowed
by mistake did not disagree with them. But perhaps nothing does
disagree with one when one dines with a Brownie. They ate so
much, laughing in equal proportion, that they had quite forgotten
the Gardener&mdash;when, all of a sudden, they heard him clicking angrily
the orchard gate, and talking to himself as he walked through.</p>

<p>"That nasty dog! It wasn't Boxer, after all. A nice joke! to
find him quietly asleep in his kennel after having hunted him, as I
thought, from one end of the garden to the other! Now for the
cherries and the children&mdash;bless us, where are the children? And
the cherries? Why, the tree is as bare as a blackthorn in February!
The starlings have been at it, after all. Oh dear! oh dear!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" echoed a voice from behind the tree, followed
by shouts of mocking laughter. Not from the children&mdash;they sat
as demure as possible, all in a ring, with their hands before them,
and in the centre the huge basket of cherries, piled as full as it could
possibly hold. But the Brownie had disappeared.</p>

<p>"You naughty brats, I'll have you punished!" cried the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gradener'">Gardener</ins>,
furious at the laughter, for he never laughed himself. But as there
was nothing wrong; the cherries being gathered&mdash;a very large crop&mdash;and
the ladder found safe in its place&mdash;it was difficult to say what
had been the harm done and who had done it.</p>

<p>So he went growling back to the house, carrying the cherries to
the mistress, who coaxed him into good temper again, as she sometimes
did; bidding also the children to behave well to him, since
he was an old man, and not really bad&mdash;only cross. As for the
little folks, she had not the slightest intention of punishing them;
and, as for Brownie, it was impossible to catch him. So nobody
was punished at all.</p>

<div class='cap'>WHICH was a place where he
did not often go, for he
preferred being warm and snug in the house. But when he felt
himself ill-used, he would wander anywhere, in order to play tricks
upon those whom he thought had done him harm; for, being only a
Brownie, and not a man, he did not understand that the best way
to revenge yourself upon your enemies is either to let them alone or
to pay them back good for evil&mdash;it disappoints them so much, and
makes them so exceedingly ashamed of themselves.</div>

<p>One day Brownie overheard the Gardener advising the Cook to
put sour milk into his bowl at night, instead of sweet.</p>

<p>"He'd never find out the difference, no more than the pigs do.
Indeed, it's my belief that a pig, or dog, or something, empties the bowl,
and not a Brownie, at all. It's just clean waste&mdash;that's what I say."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better hold your tongue, and mind your own business,"
returned the Cook, who was of a sharp temper, and would
not stand being meddled with. She began to abuse the Gardener
soundly; but his wife, who was standing by, took his part, as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
always did when any third party scolded him. So they all squabbled
together, till Brownie, hid under his coal, put his little hands over
his little ears.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what a noise these mortals do make when they quarrel!
They quite deafen me. I must teach them better manners."</p>

<p>But when the Cook slammed the door to, and left Gardener and
his wife alone, they too began to dispute between themselves.</p>

<p>"You make such a fuss over your nasty pigs, and get all the scraps
for them," said the wife. "It's of much more importance that I
should have everything Cook can spare for my chickens. Never
were such fine chickens as my last brood!"</p>

<p>"I thought they were ducklings."</p>

<p>"How you catch me up, you rude old man! They are ducklings,
and beauties, too&mdash;even though they have never seen water. Where's
the pond you promised to make for me, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Rubbish, woman! If my cows do without a pond, your ducklings
may. And why will you be so silly as to rear ducklings at all?
Fine fat chickens are a deal better. You'll find out your mistake
some day."</p>

<p>"And so will you when that old Alderney runs dry. You'll wish
you had taken my advice, and fattened and sold her."</p>

<p>"Alderney cows won't sell for fattening, and women's advice is
never worth twopence. Yours isn't worth even a half-penny. What
are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't laughing," said the wife, angrily; and, in truth, it was
not she, but little Brownie, running under the barrow which the
Gardener was wheeling along, and very much amused that people
should be so silly as to squabble about nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It was still early morning; for, whatever this old couple's faults
might be, laziness was not one of them. The wife rose with the
dawn to feed her poultry and collect her eggs; the husband also got
through as much work by breakfast-time as many an idle man
does by noon. But Brownie had been beforehand with them this
day.</p>

<p>When all the fowls came running to be fed, the big Brahma hen
who had watched the ducklings was seen wandering forlornly about,
and clucking mournfully for her young brood&mdash;she could not find
them anywhere. Had she been able to speak, she might have told
how a large white Aylesbury duck had waddled into the farmyard,
and waddled out again, coaxing them after her, no doubt in search
of a pond. But missing they were, most certainly.</p>

<p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck!" mourned the miserable hen-mother&mdash;and,
"Oh, my ducklings, my ducklings!" cried the Gardener's wife&mdash;"Who
can have carried off my beautiful ducklings?"</p>

<p>"Rats, maybe," said the Gardener, cruelly, as he walked away.
And as he went he heard the squeak of a rat below his wheelbarrow.
But he could not catch it, any more than his wife could catch the
Aylesbury duck. Of course not. Both were&mdash;the Brownie!</p>

<p>Just at this moment the six little people came running into the
farmyard. When they had been particularly good, they were sometimes
allowed to go with Gardener a-milking, each carrying his or
her own mug for a drink of milk, warm from the cow. They scampered
after him&mdash;a noisy tribe, begging to be taken down to the field,
and holding out their six mugs entreatingly.</p>

<p>"What! six cupfuls of milk, when I haven't a drop to spare, and
Cook is always wanting more? Ridiculous nonsense! Get along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with you; you may come to the field&mdash;I can't hinder that&mdash;but you'll
get no milk to-day. Take your mugs back again to the kitchen."</p>

<span class="caption">A noisy tribe, holding out their six mugs entreatingly.</span>
</div>

<p>The poor little folks made the best of a bad business, and obeyed;
then followed Gardener down to the field, rather dolefully. But
it was such a beautiful morning that they soon recovered their spirits.
The grass <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shown'">shone</ins> with dew, like a sheet of diamonds, the clover
smelled so sweet, and two skylarks were singing at one another
high up in the sky. Several rabbits darted past, to their great
amusement, especially one very large rabbit&mdash;brown, not gray&mdash;which
dodged them in and out, and once nearly threw Gardener
down, pail and all, by running across his feet; which set them all
laughing, till they came where Dolly, the cow, lay chewing the cud
under a large oak-tree.</p>

<p>It was great fun to stir her up, as usual, and lie down, one after
the other, in the place where she had lain all night long, making
the grass flat, and warm, and perfumy with her sweet breath. She
let them do it, and then stood meekly by; for Dolly was the gentlest
cow in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>But this morning something strange seemed to possess her. She
altogether refused to be milked&mdash;kicked, plunged, tossed over the
pail, which was luckily empty.</p>

<p>"Bless the cow! what's wrong with her? It's surely you children's
fault. Stand off, the whole lot of you. Soh, Dolly! good Dolly!"</p>

<p>But Dolly was any thing but good. She stood switching her tail,
and looking as savage as so mild an animal possibly could look.</p>

<p>"It's all your doing, you naughty children! You have been
playing her some trick, I know," cried the Gardener, in great wrath.</p>

<p>They assured him they had done nothing, and indeed, they looked
as quiet as mice and as innocent as lambs. At length the biggest
boy pointed out a large wasp which had settled in Dolly's ear.</p>

<p>"That accounts for everything," said the Gardener.</p>

<p>But it did not mend everything; for when he tried to drive it away
it kept coming back and back again, and buzzing round his own
head and the cow's with a voice that the children thought was less
like a buzz of a wasp than the sound of a person laughing. At
length it frightened Dolly to such an extent that, with one wild
bound she darted right away, and galloped off to the farther end of
the field.</p>

<p>"I'll get a rope and tie her legs together," cried the Gardener,
fiercely. "She shall repent giving me all this trouble&mdash;that she
shall!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed somebody. The Gardener thought it
was the children, and gave one of them an angry cuff as he walked
away. But they knew it was somebody else, and were not at all
surprised when, the minute his back was turned, Dolly came walking
quietly back, led by a little wee brown man who scarcely reached up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to her knees. Yet she let him guide her, which he did as gently
as possible, though the string he held her by was no thicker than a
spider web, floating from one of her horns.</p>

<p>"Soh, Dolly! good Dolly!" cried Brownie, mimicking the Gardener's
voice. "Now we'll see what we can do. I want my breakfast
badly&mdash;don't you, little folks?"</p>

<p>Of course they did, for the morning air made them very hungry.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;wait a bit, though. Old people should be served
first, you know. Besides, I want to go to bed."</p>

<p>"Go to bed in the daylight!" The children all laughed, and then
looked quite shy and sorry, lest they might have seemed rude to
the little Brownie. But he&mdash;he liked fun; and never took offence
when none was meant.</p>

<p>He placed himself on the milking-stool, which was so high that
his little legs were dangling half-way down, and milked and milked&mdash;Dolly
standing as still as possible&mdash;till he had filled the whole pail.
Most astonishing cow! she gave as much as two cows; and such
delicious milk as it was&mdash;all frothing and yellow&mdash;richer than even
Dolly's milk had ever been before. The children's mouths watered
for it, but not a word said they&mdash;even when, instead of giving it to
them, Brownie put his own mouth to the pail, and drank and drank,
till it seemed as if he were never going to stop. But it was decidedly
a relief to them when he popped his head up again, and lo! the pail
was as full as ever!</p>

<p>"Now, little ones, now's your turn. Where are your mugs?"</p>

<p>All answered mournfully, "We've got none. Gardener made us
take them back again."</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;all right. Gather me half a dozen of the biggest
buttercups you can find."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"What nonsense!" thought the children; but they did it. Brownie
laid the flowers in a row upon the eldest girl's lap&mdash;blew upon them
one by one, and each turned into the most beautiful golden cup that
ever was seen!</p>

<p>"Now, then, every one take his own mug, and I'll fill it."</p>

<p>He milked away&mdash;each child got a drink, and then the cups were
filled again. And all the while Dolly stood as quiet as possible&mdash;looking
benignly round, as if she would be happy to supply milk to
the whole parish, if the Brownie desired it.</p>

<p>"Soh, Dolly! Thank you, Dolly!" said he, again, mimicking the
Gardener's voice, half growling, half coaxing. And while he spoke,
the real voice was heard behind the hedge. There was a sound
as of a great wasp flying away, which made Dolly prick up her ears,
and look as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it'">if</ins> the old savageness was coming back upon her. The
children snatched up their mugs, but there was no need, they had all
turned into buttercups again.</p>

<p>Gardener jumped over the stile, as cross as two sticks, with an old
rope in his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a bother I've had! Breakfast ready, and no milk yet&mdash;and
such a row as they are making over those lost ducklings.
Stand back, you children, and don't hinder me a minute. No use
begging&mdash;not a drop of milk shall you get. Hillo, Dolly? Quiet
old girl!"</p>

<p>Quiet enough she was this time&mdash;but you might as well have milked
a plaster cow in a London milking-shop. Not one ringing drop
resounded against the empty pail; for, when they peeped in, the
children saw, to their amazement, that it was empty.</p>

<span class="caption">Each child got a drink, and then the cups were filled again.&mdash;Page 32</span>
</div>

<p>"The creature's bewitched!" cried the Gardener, in a great fury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"Or else somebody has milked her dry already. Have you done it?
or you?" he asked each of the children.</p>

<p>They might have said No&mdash;which was the literal truth&mdash;but then
it would not have been the whole truth, for they knew quite well that
Dolly had been milked, and also who had done it. And their mother
had always taught them that to make a person believe a lie is nearly
as bad as telling him one. Yet still they did not like to betray the
kind little Brownie. Greatly puzzled, they hung their heads and
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Look in your pail again," cried a voice from the other side of
Dolly. And there at the bottom was just the usual quantity of milk&mdash;no
more and no less.</p>

<p>The Gardener was very much astonished. "It must be the
Brownie!" muttered he, in a frightened tone; and, taking off his hat,
"Thank you, sir," said he to Mr. Nobody&mdash;at which the children
all burst out laughing. But they kept their own counsel, and he
was afraid to ask them any more questions.</p>

<p>By-and-by his fright wore off a little. "I only hope the milk is
good milk, and will poison nobody," said he, sulkily. "However,
that's not my affair. You children had better tell your mother all
about it. I left her in the farmyard in a pretty <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sate'">state</ins> of mind about
her ducklings."</p>

<p>Perhaps Brownie heard this, and was sorry, for he liked the children's
mother, who had always been kind to him. Besides, he
never did any body harm who did not deserve it; and though, being
a Brownie, he could hardly be said to have a conscience, he had
something which stood in the place of one&mdash;a liking to see people
happy rather than miserable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>So, instead of going to bed under his big coal for the day, when,
after breakfast, the children and their mother came out to look at a
new brood of chickens, he crept after them and hid behind the hencoop
where the old mother-hen was put, with her young ones round
her.</p>

<p>There had been great difficulty in getting her in there, for she was
a hen who hatched her brood on independent principles. Instead
of sitting upon the nice nest that the Gardener made for her, she
had twice gone into a little wood close by and made a nest for herself,
which nobody could ever find; and where she hatched in secret,
coming every second day to be fed, and then vanishing again, till at
last she re-appeared in triumph, with her chickens running after her.
The first brood there had been twelve, but of this there were fourteen&mdash;all
from her own eggs, of course, and she was uncommonly proud
of them. So was the Gardener, so was the mistress&mdash;who <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'like'">liked</ins> all
young things. Such a picture as they were! fourteen soft, yellow,
fluffy things, running about after their mother. It had been a most
troublesome business to catch&mdash;first her, and then them, to put them
under the coop. The old hen resisted, and pecked furiously at
Gardener's legs, and the chickens ran about in frantic terror, chirping
wildly in answer to her clucking.</p>

<p>At last, however, the little family was safe in shelter, and the
chickens counted over, to see that none had been lost in the scuffle.
How funny they were! looking so innocent and yet so wise, as chickens
do&mdash;peering out at the world from under their mother's wing, or
hopping over her back, or snuggled all together under her breast,
so that nothing was seen of them but a mass of yellow legs, like a
great centiped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"How happy the old hen is," said the children's mother, looking
on, and then looking compassionately at that other forlorn old hen,
who had hatched the ducklings, and kept wandering about the farmyard,
clucking miserably, "Those poor ducklings, what can have
become of them? If rats had killed them, we should have found
feathers or something; and weasels would have sucked their brains
and left them. They must have been stolen, or wandered away,
and died of cold and hunger&mdash;my poor ducklings!"</p>

<p>The mistress sighed, for she could not bear any living thing to
suffer. And the children nearly cried at the thought of what might
be happening to their pretty ducklings. That very minute a little
wee brown face peered through a hole in the hencoop, making the
old mother-hen fly furiously at it&mdash;as she did at the slightest shadow
of an enemy to her little ones. However, no harm happened&mdash;only
a guinea-fowl suddenly ran across the farmyard, screaming in its
usual harsh voice. But it was not the usual sort of guinea-fowl,
being larger and handsomer than any of theirs.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a beauty of a creature! how did it ever come into our
farmyard," cried the delighted children; and started off after it, to
catch it if possible.</p>

<p>But they ran, and they ran&mdash;through the gate and out into the
lane; and the guinea-fowl still ran on before them, until, turning
round a corner, they lost sight of it, and immediately saw something
else, equally curious. Sitting on the top of a big thistle&mdash;so big
that he must have had to climb it just like a tree&mdash;was the Brownie.
His legs were crossed, and his arms too, his little brown cap was stuck
knowingly on one side, and he was laughing heartily.</p>

<p>"How do you do? Here I am again. I thought I wouldn't go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to bed after all. Shall I help you to find the ducklings? Very
well! come along."</p>

<p>They crossed the field, Brownie running beside them, and as fast
as they could, though he looked such an old man; and sometimes
turning over on legs and arms like a Catherine wheel&mdash;which they
tried to imitate, but generally failed, and only bruised their fingers
and noses.</p>

<p>He lured them on and on till they came to the wood, and to a green
path in it, which well as they knew the neighborhood, none of the
children had ever seen before. It led to a most beautiful pond, as
clear as crystal and as blue as the sky. Large trees grew round it,
dipping their branches in the water, as if they were looking at themselves
in a glass. And all about their roots were quantities of primroses&mdash;the
biggest primroses the little girls had ever seen. Down
they dropped on their fat knees, squashing more primroses than
they gathered, though they tried to gather them all; and the smallest
child even began to cry because her hands were so full that the
flowers dropped through her fingers. But the boys, older and more
practical, rather despised primroses.</p>

<p>"I thought we had come to look for ducklings," said the eldest.
"Mother is fretting dreadfully about her ducklings. Where can
they be?"</p>

<p>"Shut your eyes, and you'll see," said the Brownie, at which they
all laughed, but did it; and when they opened their eyes again, what
should they behold but a whole fleet of ducklings sailing out from
the roots of an old willow-tree, one after the other, looking as fat
and content as possible, and swimming as naturally as if they had
lived on a pond&mdash;and this particularly pond, all their days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Count them," said the Brownie, "the whole eight&mdash;quite correct.
And then try and catch them&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>Easier said than done. The boys set to work with great satisfaction&mdash;boys
do so enjoy hunting something. They coaxed them&mdash;they
shouted at them&mdash;they threw little sticks at them; but as soon
as they wanted them to go one way the fleet of ducklings immediately
turned round and sailed another way, doing it so deliberately and
majestically, that the children could not help laughing. As for little
Brownie, he sat on a branch of the willow-tree, with his legs dangling
down to the surface of the pond, kicking at the water-spiders, and
grinning with all his might. At length, quite tired out, in spite of
their fun, the children begged for his help, and he took compassion
on them.</p>

<p>"Turn round three times and see what you can find," shouted he.</p>

<p>Immediately each little boy found in his arms, and each little girl
in her pinafore, a fine fat duckling. And there being eight of them,
the two elder children had each a couple. They were rather cold
and damp, and slightly uncomfortable to cuddle, ducks not being
used to cuddling. Poor things! they struggled hard to get away.
But the children hugged them tight, and ran as fast as their legs could
carry them through the wood, forgetting, in their joy, even to say
"Thank you" to the little Brownie.</p>

<p>When they reached their mother she was as glad as they, for she
never thought to see her ducklings again; and to have them back
alive and uninjured, and watch them running to the old hen, who
received them with an ecstasy of delight, was so exciting, that nobody
thought of asking a single question as to where they had been found.</p>

<p>When the mother did ask, the children told her about Brownie's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
taking them to the beautiful pond&mdash;and what a wonderful pond it
was; how green the trees were round it; and how large the primroses
grew. They never tired of talking about it and seeking for it. But
the odd thing was that, seek as they might, they never could find it
again. Many a day did the little people roam about one by one, or
all together, round the wood, often getting themselves sadly
draggled with mud and torn with brambles&mdash;but the beautiful pond
they never found again.</p>

<p>Nor did the ducklings, I suppose; for they wandered no more from
the farmyard, to the old mother-hen's great content. They grew
up into fat and respectable ducks&mdash;five white ones and three gray
ones&mdash;waddling about, very content, though they never saw water,
except the tank which was placed for them to paddle in. They
lived a lazy, peaceful, pleasant life for a long time, and were at last
killed and eaten with green peas, one after the other, to the family's
great satisfaction, if not to their own.</p>

<div class='cap'>FOR the little Brownie, though not
given to horsemanship, did once
take a ride, and a very remarkable one it was. Shall I tell you all
about it?</div>

<p>The six little children got a present of something they had longed
for all their lives&mdash;a pony. Not a rocking-horse, but a real live pony&mdash;a
Shetland pony, too, which had traveled all the way from the
Shetland Isles to Devonshire&mdash;where every body wondered at it,
for such a creature had not been seen in the neighborhood for years
and years. She was no bigger than a donkey, and her coat, instead
of being smooth like a horse's, was shaggy like a young bear's. She
had a long tail, which had never been cut, and such a deal of hair
in her mane and over her eyes that it gave her quite a fierce countenance.
In fact, among the mild and tame Devonshire beasts, the
little Shetland pony looked almost like a wild animal. But in reality
she was the gentlest creature in the world. Before she had been
many days with them, she began to know the children quite well;
followed them about, ate corn out of the bowl they held out to her;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
nay, one day, when the eldest little girl offered her bread-and-butter,
she stooped her head and took it from the child's hand, just like a
young lady. Indeed, Jess&mdash;that was her name&mdash;was altogether so
lady-like in her behavior, that more than once Cook allowed her to
walk in at the back-door, when she stood politely warming her nose
at the kitchen-fire for a minute or two, then turned round and as
politely walked out again. But she never did any mischief; and was
so quiet and gentle a creature that she bade fair soon to become as
great a pet in the household as the dog, the cat, the kittens, the
puppies, the fowls, the ducks, the cow, the pig, and all the other
members of the family.</p>

<p>The only one who disliked her, and grumbled at her, was the
Gardener. This was odd; because, though cross to children, the
old man was kind to dumb beasts. Even his pig knew his voice and
grunted, and held out his nose to be scratched; and he always gave
each successive pig a name, Jack or Dick, and called them by it,
and was quite affectionate to them, one after the other, until the
very day that they were killed. But they were English pigs&mdash;and
the pony was Scotch&mdash;and the Devonshire Gardener hated every
thing Scotch, he said; besides, he was not used to groom's work,
and the pony required such a deal of grooming on account of her
long hair. More than once Gardener threatened to clip it short,
and turn her into a regular English pony, but the children were in
such distress and mother forbade any such spoiling of Jessie's personal
appearance.</p>

<p>At length, to keep things smooth, and to avoid the rough words
and even blows which poor Jess sometimes got, they sought in the
village for a boy to look after her, and found a great rough, shock-headed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
lad named Bill, who, for a few shillings a week, consented
to come up every morning and learn the beginning of a groom's
business; hoping to end, as his mother said he should, in sitting, like
the squire's fat coachman, as broad as he was long, on the top of
the hammer-cloth of a grand carriage, and do nothing all day but
drive a pair of horses as stout as himself a few miles along the road
and back again.</p>

<p>Bill would have liked this very much, he thought, if he could have
been a coachman all at once, for if there was one thing he disliked,
it was work. He much preferred to lie in the sun all day and do
nothing; and he only agreed to come and take care of Jess because
she was such a very little pony, that looking after her seemed next
door to doing nothing. But when he tried it, he found his mistake.
True, Jess was a very gentle beast, so quiet that the old mother-hen
with fourteen chicks used, instead of roosting with the rest of the
fowls, to come regularly into the portion of the cow-shed which was
partitioned off for a stable, and settle under a corner of Jess's manger
for the night; and in the morning the chicks would be seen running
about fearlessly among her feet and under her very nose.</p>

<p>But, for all that, she required a little management, for she did not
like her long hair to be roughly handled; it took a long time to clean
her; and, though she did not scream out like some silly little children
when her hair was combed, I am afraid she sometimes kicked and
bounced about, giving Bill a deal of trouble&mdash;all the more trouble,
the more impatient Bill was.</p>

<p>And then he had to keep within call, for the children wanted their
pony at all hours. She was their own especial property, and they
insisted upon learning to ride&mdash;even before they got a saddle. Hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
work it was to stick on Jess's bare back, but by degrees the boys did
it, turn and turn about, and even gave their sisters a turn too&mdash;a very
little one&mdash;just once round the field and back again, which was quite
enough, they considered, for girls. But they were very kind to
their little sisters, held them on so that they could not fall, and led
Jess carefully and quietly: and altogether behaved as elder brothers
should.</p>

<p>Nor did they squabble very much among themselves, though sometimes
it was rather difficult to keep their turns all fair, and remember
accurately which was which. But they did their best, being, on the
whole, extremely good children. And they were so happy to have
their pony, that they would have been ashamed to quarrel over
her.</p>

<p>Also, one very curious thing kept them on their good behavior.
Whenever they did begin to misconduct themselves&mdash;to want to ride
out of their turns, or to domineer over one another, or the boys,
joining together, tried to domineer over the girls, as I grieve to say
boys not seldom do&mdash;they used to hear in the air, right over their
heads, the crack of an unseen whip. It was none of theirs, for they
had not got a whip; that was a felicity which their father had promised
when they could all ride like a young gentleman and ladies; but there
was no mistaking the sound&mdash;indeed, it always startled Jess so that
she set off galloping, and could not be caught again for many minutes.</p>

<p>This happened several times, until one of them said, "Perhaps
it's the Brownie." Whether it was or not, it made them behave better
for a good while; till one unfortunate day the two eldest began contending
which should ride foremost and which hindmost on Jess's
back, when "Crick&mdash;crack!" went the whip in the air, frightening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the pony so much that she kicked up her heels, tossed both the boys
over her head, and scampered off, followed by a loud "Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>It certainly did not come from the two boys, who had fallen&mdash;quite
safely, but rather unpleasantly&mdash;into a large nettle-bed; whence
they crawled out, rubbing their arms and legs, and looking too much
ashamed to complain. But they were rather frightened and a little
cross, for Jess took a skittish fit, and refused to be caught and mounted
again, till the bell rang for school&mdash;when she grew as meek as possible.
Too late&mdash;for the children were obliged to run indoors, and got no
more rides for the whole day.</p>

<p>Jess was from this incident supposed to be on the same friendly
terms with Brownie as were the rest of the household. Indeed, when
she came, the children had taken care to lead her up to the coal-cellar
door and introduce her properly&mdash;for they knew Brownie was very
jealous of strangers, and often played them tricks. But after that
piece of civility he would be sure, they thought, to take her under
his protection. And sometimes, when the little Shetlander was
restless and pricked up her ears, looking preternaturally wise under
those shaggy brows of hers, the children used to say to one another,
"Perhaps she sees the Brownie."</p>

<p>Whether she did or not, Jess sometimes seemed to see a good deal
that others did not see, and was apparently a favorite with the Brownie,
for she grew and thrived so much that she soon became the pride
and delight of the children and of the whole family. You would
hardly have known her for the rough, shaggy, half-starved little
beast that had arrived a few weeks before. Her coat was so silky,
her limbs so graceful, and her head so full of intelligence, that every
body admired her. Then even Gardener began to admire her too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I'll get upon her back; it will save me walking down to
the village," said he, one day. And she actually carried him&mdash;though,
as his feet nearly touched the ground, it looked as if the man
were carrying the pony, and not the pony the man. And the children
laughed so immoderately, that he never tried it afterward.</p>

<p>Nor Bill neither, though he had once thought he should like a ride,
and got astride on Jess; but she quickly ducked her head down, and
he tumbled over it. Evidently she had her own tastes as to her
riders, and much preferred little people to big ones.</p>

<p>Pretty Jess! when cantering round the paddock with the young folk
she really was quite a picture. And when at last she got a saddle&mdash;a
new, beautiful saddle, with a pommel to take off and on, so as to
suit both boys and girls&mdash;how proud they all were, Jess included!
That day they were allowed to take her into the market-town&mdash;Gardener
leading her, as Bill could not be trusted&mdash;and every body,
even the blacksmith, who hoped by-and-by to have the pleasure of
shoeing her, said, what a beautiful pony she was!</p>

<p>After this, Gardener treated Jess a great deal better, and showed
Bill how to groom her, and kept him close at it too, which Bill did
not like at all. He was a very lazy lad, and whenever he could shirk
work he did it; and many a time when the children wanted Jess, either
there was nobody to saddle her, or she had not been properly groomed,
or Bill was away at his dinner, and they had to wait till he came back
and could put her in order to be taken out for a ride like a genteel
animal&mdash;which I am afraid neither pony nor children enjoyed half
so much as the old ways before Bill came.</p>

<p>Still, they were gradually becoming excellent little horsemen and
horsewomen&mdash;even the youngest, only four years old, whom all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rest were very tender over, and who was often held on Jess's back
and given a ride out of her turn because she was a good little girl,
and never cried for it. And seldomer and seldomer was heard the
mysterious sound of the whip in the air, which warned them of
quarreling&mdash;Brownie hated quarreling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Jess quickly ducked her head down and Bill tumbled over it.</span>
</div>

<p>In fact, their only trouble was Bill, who never came to his work
in time, and never did things when wanted, and was ill-natured, lazy,
and cross to the children, so that they disliked him very much.</p>

<p>"I wish the Brownie would punish you," said one of the boys;
"you'd behave better then."</p>

<p>"The Brownie!" cried Bill, contemptuously; "if I caught him,
I'd kick him up in the air like this!"</p>

<p>And he kicked up his cap&mdash;his only cap, it was&mdash;which, strange
to relate, flew right up, ever so high, and lodged at the very top of a
tree which overhung the stable, where it dangled for weeks and weeks,
during which time poor Bill had to go bareheaded.</p>

<p>He was very much vexed, and revenged himself by vexing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
children in all sorts of ways. They would have told their mother,
and asked her to send Bill away, only she had a great many anxieties
just then, for their old grandmother was very ill, and they did not
like to make a fuss about any thing that would trouble her.</p>

<p>So Bill staid on, and nobody found out what a bad, ill-natured,
lazy boy he was.</p>

<p>But one day the mother was sent for suddenly, not knowing when
she should be able to come home again. She was very sad, and so
were the children, for they loved their grandmother&mdash;and as the
carriage drove off they all stood crying round the front-door for ever
so long.</p>

<p>The servants even cried too&mdash;all but Bill.</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good," said he. "What a
jolly time I shall have! I'll do nothing all day long. Those troublesome
children sha'n't have Jess to ride; I'll keep her in the stable,
and then she won't get dirty, and I shall have no trouble in cleaning
her. Hurrah! what fun!"</p>

<p>He put his hands in his pockets, and sat whistling the best part of
the afternoon.</p>

<p>The children had been so unhappy, that for that day they quite
forgot Jess; but next morning, after lessons were over, they came
begging for a ride.</p>

<p>"You can't get one. The stable-door's locked and I've lost the
key." (He had it in his pocket all the time.)</p>

<p>"How is poor Jess to get her dinner?" cried a thoughtful little
girl. "Oh, how hungry she will be!"</p>

<p>And the child was quite in distress, as were the two other girls.
But the boys were more angry than sorry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was very stupid of you, Bill, to lose the key. Look about and
find it, or else break open the door."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Bill; "I dare say the key will turn up before night,
and if it doesn't, who cares? You get riding enough and too much.
I'll not bother myself about it, or Jess either."</p>

<p>And Bill sauntered away. He was a big fellow, and the little lads
were rather afraid of him. But as he walked, he could not keep
his hand out of his trowsers-pocket, where the key felt growing heavier
and heavier, till he expected it every minute to tumble through and
come out at his boots&mdash;convicting him before all the children of having
told a lie.</p>

<p>Nobody was in the habit of telling lies to them, so they never suspected
him, but went innocently searching about for the key&mdash;Bill
all the while clutching it fast. But every time he touched it, he felt
his fingers pinched, as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it'">if</ins> there was a cockroach in his pocket&mdash;or
little lobster&mdash;or something, anyhow, that had claws. At last, fairly
frightened, he made an excuse to go into the cow-shed, took the key
out of his pocket and looked at it, and finally hid it in a corner of the
manger, among the hay.</p>

<p>As he did so, he heard a most extraordinary laugh, which was
certainly not from Dolly the cow, and, as he went out of the shed,
he felt the same sort of pinch at his ankles, which made him so angry
that he kept striking with his whip in all directions, but hit nobody
for nobody was there.</p>

<p>But Jess&mdash;who, as soon as she heard the children's voices, set
up a most melancholy whinnying behind the locked stable-door&mdash;began
to neigh energetically. And Boxer barked, and the hens
cackled, and the guinea-fowls cried "Come back, come back!" in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
their usual insane fashion&mdash;indeed, the whole farmyard seemed in
such an excited state, that the children got frightened lest Gardener
should scold them, and ran away, leaving Bill master of the field.</p>

<p>What an idle day he had! How he sat on the wall with his hands
in his pockets, and lounged upon the fence, and sauntered around
the garden! At length, absolutely tired of doing nothing, he went
and talked with the Gardener's wife while she was hanging out her
clothes. Gardener had gone down to the lower field, with all the
little folks after him, so that he knew nothing of Bill's idling, or it
might have come to an end.</p>

<p>By-and-by Bill thought it was time to go home to his supper.
"But first I'll give Jess her corn," said he, "double quantity, and
then I need not come back to give her her breakfast so early in the
morning. Soh! you greedy beast! I'll be at you presently, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'f'">if</ins> you
don't stop that noise."</p>

<p>For Jess, at sound of his footsteps, was heard to whinny in the
most imploring manner, enough to have melted a heart of stone.</p>

<p>"The key&mdash;where on earth did I put the key?" cried Bill, whose
constant habit it was to lay things out of his hand and then forget
where he had put them, causing himself endless loss of time in
searching for them&mdash;as now. At last he suddenly remembered the
corner of the cow's manger, where he felt sure he had left it. But
the key was not there.</p>

<p>"You can't have eaten it, you silly old cow," said he, striking
Dolly on the nose as she rubbed herself against him&mdash;she was an
affectionate beast. "Nor you, you stupid old hen!" kicking the
mother of the brood, who, with her fourteen chicks, being shut out
of their usual roosting-place&mdash;Jess's stable&mdash;kept pecking about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
under Dolly's legs. "It can't have gone without hands&mdash;of
course it can't." But most certainly the key was gone.</p>

<p>What in the world should Bill do? Jess kept on making a pitiful
complaining. No wonder, as she had not tasted food since morning.
It would have made any kind-hearted person quite sad to hear her,
thinking how exceedingly hungry the poor pony must be.</p>

<p>Little did Bill care for that, or for anything, except that he should
be sure to get into trouble as soon as he was found out. When he
heard Gardener coming into the farmyard, with the children after
him, Bill bolted over the wall like a flash of lightning, and ran away
home, leaving poor Jess to her fate.</p>

<p>All the way he seemed to hear at his heels a little dog yelping, and
then a swarm of gnats buzzing round his head, and altogether was
so perplexed and bewildered, that when he got into his mother's
cottage he escaped into bed, and pulled the blanket over his ears
to shut out the noise of the dog and the gnats, which at last turned into
a sound like somebody laughing. It was not his mother, she didn't
often laugh, poor soul!&mdash;Bill bothered her quite too much for that,
and he knew it. Dreadfully frightened, he hid his head under the
bedclothes, determined to go to sleep and think about nothing till
next day.</p>

<p>Meantime Gardener returned, with all the little people trooping
after him. He had been rather kinder to them than usual this day,
because he knew their mother had gone away in trouble, and now
he let them help him to roll the gravel, and fetch up Dolly to be
milked, and watch him milk her in the cow-shed&mdash;where, it being
nearly winter, she always spent the night now. They were so well
amused that they forgot all about their disappointment as to the ride,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and Jess did not remind them of it by her whinnying. For as soon
as Bill was gone she grew silent.</p>

<p>At last one little girl, the one who had cried over Jess's being
left hungry, remembered the poor pony, and, peeping through a crevice
in the cow-shed, saw her stand contentedly munching at a large bowlful
of corn.</p>

<p>"So Bill did find the key. I'm very glad," thought the kind
little maiden, and to make sure looked again, when&mdash;what do you
think she beheld squatting on the manger? Something brown&mdash;either
a large brown rat, or a small brown man. But she held her
tongue, since, being a very little girl, people sometimes laughed at
her for the strange things she saw. She was quite certain she did
see them, for all that.</p>

<p>So she and the rest of the children went indoors and to bed. When
they were fast asleep, something happened. Something so curious,
that the youngest boy, who, thinking he heard Jess neighing, got up
to look out, was afraid to tell, lest he too should be laughed at, and
went back to bed immediately.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, a little old brown man carrying a lantern,
or at least having a light in his hand that looked like a lantern&mdash;went
and unlocked Jess's stable, and patted her pretty head. At first she
started, but soon she grew quiet and pleased, and let him do what
he chose with her. He began rubbing her down, making the same
funny hissing with his mouth that Bill did, and all grooms do&mdash;I never
could find out why. But Jess evidently liked it, and stood as good
as possible.</p>

<span class="caption">Up the bank she scrambled, her long hair dripping.&mdash;Page 55</span>
</div>

<p>"Isn't it nice to be clean?" said the wee man, talking to her as if
she were a human being, or a Brownie. "And I dare say your poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
little legs ache with standing so long. Shall we have a run together?
the moon shines bright in the clear, cold night. Dear me! I'm
talking poetry."</p>

<p>But Brownies are not poetical fairies, quite commonplace, and up
to all sorts of work. So, while he talked, he was saddling and bridling
Jess, she not objecting in the least. Finally, he jumped on her
back.</p>

<p>"'Off, said the stranger&mdash;off, off, and away!'" sang Brownie
mimicking a song of the Cook's. People in that house often heard
their songs repeated in the oddest way, from room to room, everybody
fancying it was somebody else that did it. But it was only
the Brownie. "Now, 'A southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim
a hunting morning!'"</p>

<p>Or night&mdash;for it was the middle of the night, though bright as
day&mdash;and Jess galloped and the Brownie sat on her back as merrily
as if they had gone hunting together all their days.</p>

<p>Such a steeple-chase it was! They cleared the farmyard at a
single bound, and went flying down the road, and across the ploughed
field, and into the wood. Then out into the open country, and by-and-by
into a dark, muddy lane&mdash;and oh! how muddy Devonshire
lanes can be sometimes!</p>

<p>"Let's go into the water to wash ourselves," said Brownie, and
coaxed Jess into a deep stream, which she swam as bravely as possible&mdash;she
had not had such a frolic since she left her native Shetland
Isles. Up the bank she scrambled, her long hair dripping as if she
had been a water-dog instead of a pony. Brownie, too, shook himself
like a rat or a beaver, throwing a shower round him in all directions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind; at it again, my lass!" and he urged Jess into the
water once more. Out she came, wetter and brisker than ever,
and went back home again through the lane, and the wood, and the
ploughed field, galloping like the wind, and tossing back her ears
and mane and tail, perfectly frantic with enjoyment.</p>

<p>But when she reached her stable, the plight she was in would have
driven any respectable groom frantic too. Her sides were white with
foam, and the mud was sticking all over her like a plaster. As for
her beautiful long hair, it was all caked together in a tangle, as if
all the combs in the world would never make it smooth again. Her
mane especially was plaited into knots, which people in Devonshire
call elf-locks, and say, when they find them on their horses, that it
is because the fairies have been riding them.</p>

<p>Certainly, poor Jess had been pretty well ridden that night. When
just as the dawn began to break, Gardener got up and looked into
the farmyard, his sharp eye caught sight of the stable-door wide open.</p>

<p>"Well done, Bill," shouted he, "up early at last. One hour
before breakfast is worth three after."</p>

<p>But no Bill was there; only Jess, trembling and shaking, all in a
foam, and muddy from head to foot, but looking perfectly cheerful
in her mind. And out from under her fore legs ran a small creature
which Gardener mistook for Tiny, only Tiny was gray, and this
dog was brown, of course!</p>

<p>I should not like to tell you all that was said to Bill when, an hour
after breakfast-time, he came skulking up to the farm. In fact, words
failing, Gardener took a good stick and laid it about Bill's shoulders,
saying he would either do this, or tell the mistress of him, and how
he had left the stable-door open all night, and some bad fellow had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stolen Jess, and galloped her all across the country, till, if she hadn't
been the cleverest pony in the world, she never could have got back
again.</p>

<p>Bill durst not contradict this explanation of the story, especially
as the key was found hanging up in its proper place by the kitchen
door. And when he went to fetch it, he heard the most extraordinary
sound in the coal-cellar close by&mdash;like somebody snoring
or laughing. Bill took to his heels, and did not come back for a
whole hour.</p>

<p>But when he did come back, he made himself as busy as possible.
He cleaned Jess, which was half a day's work at least. Then he
took the little people a ride, and afterward put his stable in the most
beautiful order, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'altogetherwas'">altogether was</ins> such a changed Bill, that Gardener
told him he must have left himself at home and brought back somebody
else: whether or not, the boy certainly improved, so that there
was less occasion to find fault with him afterward.</p>

<p>Jess lived to be quite an old pony, and carried a great many people&mdash;little
people always, for she herself never grew any bigger. But
I don't think she ever carried a Brownie again.</p>

<div class='cap'>WINTER was a grand time with the six little children
especially when they had frost and snow. This happened
seldom enough for it to be the greatest possible treat when it did
happen; and it never lasted very long, for the winters are warm in
Devonshire.</div>

<p>There was a little lake three fields off, which made the most splendid
sliding-place imaginable. No skaters went near it&mdash;it was not
large enough; and besides, there was nobody to skate, the neighborhood
being lonely. The lake itself looked the loneliest place imaginable.
It was not very deep&mdash;not deep enough to drown a man&mdash;but
it had a gravelly bottom, and was always very clear. Also, the
trees round it grew so thick that they sheltered it completely from
the wind, so, when it did freeze, it generally froze as smooth as a sheet
of glass.</p>

<p>"The lake bears!" was such a grand event, and so rare, that when
it did occur, the news came at once to the farm, and the children
carried it as quickly to their mother. For she had promised them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that, if such a thing did happen this year&mdash;it did not happen every
year&mdash;lessons should be stopped entirely, and they should all go
down to the lake and slide, if they liked, all day long.</p>

<p>So one morning, just before Christmas, the eldest boy ran in with
a countenance of great delight.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, the lake bears!" (It was rather a compliment
to call it a lake, it being only about twenty yards across and forty
long.) "The lake really bears!"</p>

<p>"Who says so?"</p>

<p>"Bill. Bill has been on it for an hour this morning, and has made
us two such beautiful slides, he says&mdash;an upslide and a down-slide.
May we go directly?"</p>

<p>The mother hesitated.</p>

<p>"You promised, you know," pleaded the children.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; only be careful."</p>

<p>"And may we slide all day long, and never come home for dinner
or any thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like. Only Gardener must go with you, and stay
all day."</p>

<p>This they did not like at all; nor, when Gardener was spoken to,
did he.</p>

<p>"You bothering children! I wish you may all get a good ducking
in the lake! Serve you right for making me lose a day's work, just
to look after you little monkeys. I've a great mind to tell your
mother I won't do it."</p>

<p>But he did not, being fond of his mistress. He was also fond of
his work, but he had no notion of play. I think the saying of, "All
work and no play makes Jack a dull boy," must have been applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to him, for Gardener, whatever he had been as a boy, was certainly
a dull and melancholy man. The children used to say that if he and
idle Bill could have been kneaded into one, and baked in the oven&mdash;a
very warm oven&mdash;they would have come out rather a pleasant
person.</p>

<p>As it was, Gardener was any thing but a pleasant person; above
all, to spend a long day with, and on the ice, where one needs all
one's cheerfulness and good-humor to bear pinched fingers and
numbed toes, and trips and tumbles, and various uncomfortablenesses.</p>

<p>"He'll growl at us all day long&mdash;he'll be a regular spoil-sport!"
lamented the children. "Oh! mother, mightn't we go alone?"</p>

<p>"No!" said the mother; and her "No" meant no, though she was
always very kind. They argued the point no more, but started off,
rather downhearted. But soon they regained their spirits, for it
was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in the original">a</ins> bright, clear, frosty day&mdash;the sun shining, though not enough
to melt the ice, and just sufficient to lie like a thin sprinkling over
the grass, and turn the brown branches into white ones. The little
people danced along to keep themselves warm, carrying between
them a basket which held their lunch. A very harmless lunch it
was&mdash;just a large brown loaf and a lump of cheese, and a knife to
cut it with. Tossing the basket about in their fun, they managed
to tumble the knife out, and were having a search for it in the long
grass, when Gardener came up, grumpily enough.</p>

<p>"To think of trusting you children with one of the table-knives
and a basket! what a fool Cook must be! I'll tell her so; and if
they're lost she'll blame me: give me the things."</p>

<p>He put the knife angrily in one pocket. "Perhaps it will cut a hole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in it," said one of the children, in rather a pleased tone than otherwise;
then he turned the lunch all out on the grass and crammed it
in the other pocket, hiding the basket behind a hedge.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'll not be at the trouble of carrying it," said he, when
the children cried out at this; "and you shan't carry it either, for you'll
knock it about and spoil it. And as for your lunch getting warm in
my pocket, why, so much the better this cold day."</p>

<p>It was not a lively joke, and they knew the pocket was very dirty;
indeed, the little girls had seen him stuff a dead rat into it only the
day before. They looked ready to cry; but there was no help
for them, except going back and complaining to their mother, and
they did not like to do that. Besides, they knew that, though Gardener
was cross, he was trustworthy, and she would never let them
go down to the lake without him.</p>

<p>So they followed him, trying to be as good as they could&mdash;though
it was difficult work. One of them proposed pelting him with snowballs,
as they pelted each other. But at the first&mdash;which fell in his
neck&mdash;he turned round so furiously, that they never sent a second,
but walked behind him as meek as mice.</p>

<p>As they went, they heard little steps pattering after them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the Brownie to play with us&mdash;I wish he would,"
whispered the youngest girl to the eldest boy, whose hand she generally
held; and then the little pattering steps sounded again, traveling
through the snow, but they saw nobody&mdash;so they said nothing.</p>

<p>The children would have liked to go straight to the ice; but Gardener
insisted on taking them a mile round, to look at an extraordinary
animal which a farmer there had just got&mdash;sent by his
brother in Australia. The two old men stood gossiping so long that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the children wearied extremely. Every minute seemed an hour till
they got on the ice.</p>

<p>At last one of them pulled Gardener's coat-tails, and whispered
that they were quite ready to go.</p>

<p>"Then I'm not," and he waited ever so much longer, and got a
drink of hot cider, which made him quite lively for a little while.</p>

<p>But by the time they reached the lake, he was as cross as ever.
He struck the ice with his stick, but made no attempt to see if it really
did bear&mdash;though he would not allow the children to go one step
upon it till he had tried.</p>

<p>"I know it doesn't bear, and you'll just have to go home again&mdash;a
good thing too&mdash;saves me from losing a day's work."</p>

<p>"Try, only try; Bill said it bore," implored the boys, and looked
wistfully at the two beautiful slides&mdash;just as Bill said, one up and
one down&mdash;stretching all across the lake; "of course it bears, or Bill
could not have made these slides."</p>

<p>"Bill's an ass!" said the Gardener, and put his heavy foot cautiously
on the ice. Just then there was seen jumping across it a creature
which certainly had never been seen on ice before. It made the
most extraordinary bounds on its long hind legs, with its little fore
legs tucked up in front of it as if it wanted to carry a muff; and its
long, stiff tail sticking out straight behind, to balance it itself with
apparently. The children at first started with surprise, and then
burst out laughing, for it was the funniest creature, and had the
funniest way of getting along, that they had ever seen in their lives.</p>

<p>"It's the kangaroo!" said Gardener, in great excitement. "It
has got loose&mdash;and it's sure to be lost&mdash;and what a way Mr. Giles
will be in! I must go and tell him. Or stop, I'll try and catch it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But in vain&mdash;it darted once or twice across the ice, dodging him,
as it were; and once coming so close that he nearly caught it by the
tail&mdash;to the children's great delight&mdash;then it vanished entirely.</p>

<p>"I must go and tell Mr. Giles directly," said Gardener, and then
stopped. For he had promised not to leave the children; and it was
such a wild-goose chase, after an escaped kangaroo. But he might
get half a crown as a reward, and he was sure of another glass of cider.</p>

<p>"You just stop quiet here, and I'll be back in five minutes," said
he to the children. "You may go a little way on the ice&mdash;I think it's
sound enough; only mind you don't tumble in, for there'll be nobody
to pull you out."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said the children, clapping their hands. They did not
care for tumbling in, and were quite glad there was nobody there
to pull them out. They hoped Gardener would stop a very long
time away&mdash;only, as some one suggested when he was seen hurrying
across the snowy field, he had taken away their lunch in his pocket,
too.</p>

<p>Off they darted, the three elder boys, with a good run; the biggest
of the girls followed after them; and soon the whole four were skimming
one after the other, as fast as a railway train, across the slippery
ice. And, like a railway train, they had a collision, and all came
tumbling one over the other, with great screaming and laughing, to
the high bank on the other side. The two younger ones stood mournfully
watching the others from the opposite bank&mdash;when there stood
beside them a small brown man.</p>

<p>"Ho-ho! little people," said he, coming between them and taking
hold of a hand of each. His was so warm and theirs so cold, that it
was quite comfortable. And then, somehow, they found in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
mouths a nice lozenge&mdash;I think it was peppermint, but am not sure;
which comforted them still more.</p>

<p>"Did you want me to play with you?" cried the Brownie; "then
here I am. What shall we do? Have a turn on the ice together?"</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. The two children felt themselves
floating along&mdash;it was more like floating than running&mdash;with Brownie
between them; up the lake, and down the lake, and across the lake,
not at all interfering with the sliders&mdash;indeed, it was a great deal
better than sliding. Rosy and breathless, their toes so nice and
warm, and their hands feeling like mince-pies just taken out of the
oven&mdash;the little ones came to a standstill.</p>

<p>The elder ones stopped their sliding, and looked toward Brownie
with entreating eyes. He swung himself up to a willow bough, and
then turned head over heels on to the ice.</p>

<p>"Halloo! you don't mean to say you big ones want a race too!
Well, come along&mdash;if the two eldest will give a slide to the little ones."</p>

<p>He watched them take a tiny sister between them, and slide her
up one slide and down another, screaming with delight. Then he
took the two middle children in either hand.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, and away!" Off they started&mdash;scudding along
as light as feathers and as fast as steam-engines, over the smooth,
black ice, so clear that they could see the bits of stick and water-grasses
frozen in it, and even the little fishes swimming far down below&mdash;if
they had only looked long enough.</p>

<p>When all had had their fair turns, they began to be frightfully
hungry.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 427px;">

<span class="caption">The two little children felt themselves floating along&mdash;with Brownie between them&mdash;Page 64</span>
</div>

<p>"Catch a fish for dinner, and I'll lend you a hook," said Brownie.
At which they all laughed, and then looked rather grave. Pulling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a cold, raw live fish from under the ice and eating it was not a pleasant
idea of dinner. "Well, what would you like to have? Let the little
one choose."</p>

<p>She said, after thinking a minute, that she should like a currant-cake.</p>

<p>"And I'd give all you a bit of it&mdash;a very large bit&mdash;I would indeed!"
added she, almost with the tears in her eyes&mdash;she was so very
hungry.</p>

<p>"Do it, then!" said the Brownie, in his little squeaking voice.</p>

<p>Immediately the stone that the little girl was sitting on&mdash;a round,
hard stone, and so cold!&mdash;turned into a nice hot cake&mdash;so hot that
she jumped up directly. As soon as she saw what it was, she clapped
her hands for joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful cake! only we haven't got a
knife to cut it."</p>

<p>The boys felt in all their pockets, but somehow their knives never
were there when they were wanted.</p>

<p>"Look! you've got one in your hand!" said Brownie to the little
one; and that minute a bit of stick she held turned into a bread-knife&mdash;silver,
with an ivory handle&mdash;big enough and sharp enough,
without being too sharp. For the youngest girl was not allowed to use
sharp knives, though she liked cutting things excessively, especially
cakes.</p>

<p>"That will do. Sit you down and carve the dinner. Fair shares
and don't let any body eat too much. Now begin, ma'am," said
the Brownie, quite politely, as if she had been ever so old.</p>

<p>Oh, how proud the little girl was. How bravely she set to work,
and cut five of the biggest slices you ever saw, and gave them to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
brothers and sisters, and was just going to take the sixth slice for
herself, when she remembered the Brownie.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said she, as politely as he, though she was
such a very little girl, and turned round to the wee brown man. But
he was nowhere to be seen. The slices of cake in the children's
hands remained cake, and uncommonly good it was, and such substantial
eating that it did nearly the same as dinner; but the cake
itself turned suddenly to a stone again, and the knife into a bit of
stick.</p>

<p>For there was the Gardener coming clumping along by the bank
of the lake, and growling as he went.</p>

<p>"Have you got the kangaroo?" shouted the children, determined
to be civil, if possible.</p>

<p>"This <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'plaee'">place</ins> is bewitched, I think," said he, "The kangaroo was
fast asleep in the cow-shed. What! how dare you laugh at me?"</p>

<p>But they hadn't laughed at all. And they found it no laughing
matter, poor children, when Gardener came on the ice, and began to
scold them and order them about. He was perfectly savage with
crossness; for the people at Giles's Farm had laughed at him very
much, and he did not like to be laughed at&mdash;and at the top of the
field he had by chance met his mistress, and she asked him severely
how he could think of leaving the children alone.</p>

<p>Altogether, his conscience pricked him a good deal, and when
people's consciences prick them, sometimes they get angry with
other people, which is very silly, and only makes matters worse.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing all this time?" said he.</p>

<p>"All this five minutes?" said the oldest boy, mischievously; for
Gardener was only to be away five minutes, and he had staid a full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
hour. Also, when he fumbled in his pocket for the children's lunch&mdash;to
stop their tongues, perhaps&mdash;he found it was not there.</p>

<p>They set up a great outcry; for, in spite of the cake, they could
have eaten a little more. Indeed, the frost had such an effect upon
all their appetites, that they felt not unlike that celebrated gentleman
of whom it is told that</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He ate a cow, and ate a calf,<br />
He ate an ox, and ate a half;<br />
He ate a church, he ate the steeple,<br />
He ate the priest, and all the people,<br />
And said he hadn't had enough then."<br />
</div>

<p>"We're so hungry, so very hungry! Couldn't you go back again
and fetch us some dinner?" cried they, entreatingly.</p>

<p>"Not I, indeed. You may go back to dinner yourselves. You
shall, indeed, for I want my dinner too. Two hours is plenty long
enough to stop on the ice."</p>

<p>"It isn't two hours&mdash;it's only one."</p>

<p>"Well, one will do better than more. You're all right now&mdash;and
you might soon tumble in, or break your legs on the slide. So come
away home."</p>

<p>It wasn't kind of Gardener, and I don't wonder the children felt
it hard; indeed, the eldest boy resisted stoutly.</p>

<p>"Mother said we might stop all day, and we will stop all day.
You may go home if you like."</p>

<p>"I won't, and you shall!" said Gardener, smacking a whip that
he carried in his hand. "Stop till I catch you, and I'll give you this
about your back, my fine gentleman."</p>

<p>And he tried to follow, but the little fellow darted across the ice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
objecting to be either caught or whipped. It may have been rather
naughty, but I am afraid it was great fun dodging the Gardener up
and down; he being too timid to go on the slippery ice, and sometimes
getting so close that the whip nearly touched the lad.</p>

<p>"Bless us! there's the kangaroo again!" said he, starting. Just
as he had caught the boy, and lifted the whip, the creature was seen
hop-hopping from bank to bank. "I can't surely be mistaken this
time; I must catch it."</p>

<p>Which seemed quite easy, for it limped as if it was lame, or as if
the frost had bitten its toes, poor beast! Gardener went after it,
walking cautiously on the slippery, crackling ice, and never minding
whether or not he walked on the slides, though they called out to him
that his nailed boots would spoil them.</p>

<p>But whether it was that ice which bears a boy will not bear a man,
or whether at each lame step of the kangaroo there came a great crack,
is more than I can tell. However, just as Gardener reached the
middle of the lake, the ice suddenly broke, and in he popped.&mdash;The
kangaroo too, apparently, for it was not seen afterward.</p>

<p>What a hullaballoo the poor man made! Not that he was drowning&mdash;the
lake was too shallow to drown any body, but he got terribly
wet, and the water was very cold. He soon scrambled out, the boys
helping him; and then he hobbled home as fast as he could, not even
saying thank you, or taking the least notice of them.</p>

<p>Indeed, nobody took notice of them&mdash;nobody came to fetch them,
and they might have staid sliding the whole afternoon. Only somehow
they did not feel quite easy in their minds. And though the
hole in the ice closed up immediately, and it seemed as firm as ever,
still they did not like to slide upon it again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The ice <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suddenl'">suddenly</ins> broke, and in he popped.</span>
</div>
<p>"I think we had better go home and tell mother every thing,"
said one of them. "Besides, we ought to see what has become of
poor Gardener. He was very wet."</p>

<p>"Yes, but oh, how funny he
looked!" And they all burst out
laughing at the recollection of the
figure he cut, scrambling out
through the ice with his trowsers
dripping up to the knees, and the
water running out of his boots,
making a little pool, wherever he
stepped.</p>

<p>"And it freezes so hard, that by
the time he gets home his clothes
will be as stiff as a board. His
wife will have to put him to the
fire to thaw before he can get out
of them."</p>



<p>Again the little people burst into
shouts of laughter. Although
they laughed, they were a little
sorry for the poor old Gardener,
and hoped no great harm had come to him, but that he had got safe
home and been dried by his own warm fire.</p>

<p>The frosty mist was beginning already to rise, and the sun, though
still high up in the sky, looked like a ball of red-hot iron as the six
children went homeward across the fields&mdash;merry enough still, but
not quite so merry as they had been a few hours before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's hope mother won't be vexed with us," said they, "but will
let us come back again to-morrow. It wasn't our fault that Gardener
tumbled in."</p>

<p>As somebody said this, they all heard quite distinctly, "Ha, ha,
ha!" and "Ho, ho, ho!" and a sound of little steps pattering behind.</p>

<p>But whatever they thought, nobody ventured to say that it was the
fault of the Brownie.</p>

<div class='cap'>TILL the next time; but when there
is a Brownie in the house, no
one can say that any of his tricks will be the last. For there's no
stopping a Brownie, and no getting rid of him either. This one had
followed the family from house to house, generation after generation&mdash;never
any older, and sometimes seeming even to grow younger by
the tricks he played. In fact, though he looked like an old man, he
was a perpetual child.</div>

<p>To the children he never did any harm, quite the contrary. And
his chief misdoings were against those who vexed the children. But
he gradually made friends with several of his grown up enemies.
Cook, for instance, who had ceased to be lazy at night and late in
the morning, found no more black footmarks on her white table cloth.
And Brownie found his basin of milk waiting for him, night after
night, behind the coal-cellar door.</p>

<p>Bill, too, got on well enough with his pony, and Jess was taken
no more night-rides. No ducks were lost; and Dolly gave her milk
quite comfortably to whoever milked her. Alas! this was either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Bill or the Gardener's wife now. After that adventure on the ice,
poor Gardener very seldom appeared; when he did, it was on two
crutches, for he had had rheumatism in his feet, and could not stir
outside his cottage door. Bill, therefore, had double work; which
was probably all the better for Bill.</p>

<p>The garden had to take care of itself; but this being winter-time, it
did not much signify. Besides, Brownie seldom went into the
garden, except in summer; during the hard weather he preferred
to stop in his coal-cellar. It might not have been a lively place,
but it was warm, and he liked it.</p>

<p>He had company there, too; for when the cat had more kittens&mdash;the
kitten he used to tease being grown up now&mdash;they were all put
in a hamper in the coal-cellar; and of cold nights Brownie used to
jump in beside them, and be as warm and as cozy as a kitten himself.
The little things never were heard to mew; so it may be supposed
they liked his society. And the old mother-cat evidently bore him
no malice for the whipping she had got by mistake; so Brownie must
have found means of coaxing her over. One thing you may be
sure of&mdash;all the while she and her kittens were in his coal-cellar, he
took care never to turn himself into a mouse.</p>

<p>He was spending the winter, on the whole, very comfortably,
without much trouble either to himself or his neighbors, when one
day, the coal-cellar being nearly empty, two men, and a great wagon-load
of coals behind them, came to the door, Gardener's wife following.</p>

<p>"My man says you're to give the cellar a good cleaning out before
you put any more in," said she, in her sharp voice; "and don't be
lazy about it. It'll not take you ten minutes, for it's nearly all coal-dust,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
except that one big lump in the corner&mdash;you might clear that
out too."</p>

<p>"Stop, it's the Brownie's lump! better not meddle with it," whispered
the little scullery-maid.</p>

<p>"Don't you meddle with matters that can't concern you," said
the Gardener's wife, who had been thinking what a nice help it would
be to her fire. To be sure, it was not her lump of coal, but she
thought she might take it; the mistress would never miss it, or the
Brownie either. He must be a very silly old Brownie to live under
a lump of coal.</p>

<p>So she argued with herself, and made the men lift it. "You must
lift it, you see, if you are to sweep the coal-cellar out clean. And
you may as well put it on the barrow, and I'll wheel it out of your
way."</p>

<p>This she said in quite a civil voice, lest they should tell of her, and
stood by while it was being done. It was done without any thing
happening, except that a large rat ran out of the coal-cellar door,
bouncing against her feet, and frightening her so much that she
nearly tumbled down.</p>

<p>"See what nonsense it is to talk of Brownies living in a coal-cellar.
Nothing lives there but rats, and I'll have them poisoned pretty soon,
and get rid of them."</p>

<p>But she was rather frightened all the same, for the rat had been
such a very big rat, and had looked at her, as it darted past, with
such wild, bright, mischievous eyes&mdash;brown eyes, of course&mdash;that
she all but jumped with surprise.</p>

<p>However, she had got her lump of coal, and was wheeling it quietly
away, nobody seeing, to her cottage at the bottom of the garden. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was a hard-worked woman, and her husband's illness made things
harder for her. Still, she was not quite easy at taking what did not
belong to her.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose any body will miss the coal," she repeated.
"I dare say the mistress would have given it to me if I had asked her;
and as for its being the Brownie's lump&mdash;fudge! Bless us! what's
that?"</p>

<p>For the barrow began to creak dreadfully, and every creak sounded
like the cry of a child, just as if the wheel were going over its leg
and crushing its poor little bones.</p>

<p>"What a horrid noise! I must grease the barrow. If only I
knew where they keep the grease-box. All goes wrong, now my old
man's laid up. Oh, dear! oh dear!"</p>

<p>For suddenly the barrow had tilted over, though there was not a
single stone near, and the big coal was tumbled on to the ground,
where it broke into a thousand pieces. Gathering it up again was
hopeless, and it made such a mess on the gravel-walk, that the old
woman was thankful her misfortune happened behind the privet
hedge, where nobody was likely to come.</p>

<p>"I'll take a broom and sweep it up to-morrow. Nobody goes near
the orchard now, except me when I hang out the clothes; so I need
say nothing about it to the old man or any body. But ah! deary me,
what a beautiful lot of coal I've lost!"</p>

<p>She stood and looked at it mournfully, and then went into her cottage,
where she found two or three of the little children keeping Gardener
company. They did not dislike to do this now; but he was so much
kinder than he used to be&mdash;so quiet and patient, though he suffered
very much. And he had never once reproached them for what they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
always remembered&mdash;how it was ever since he was on the ice with
them that he had got the rheumatism.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="226" height="450" alt="Suddenly the barrow had tilted over." title="" />
<span class="caption">Suddenly the barrow had tilted over.</span>
</div>

<p>So, one or other of them made a point of going to see him every
day, and telling him all the funny
things they could think of&mdash;indeed,
it was a contest among them who
should first make Gardener laugh.
They did not succeed in doing
that exactly; but they managed to
make him smile; and he was always
gentle and grateful to them;
so that they sometimes thought
it was rather nice his being ill.</p>

<p>But his wife was not pleasant;
she grumbled all day long, and
snapped at him and his visitors;
being especially snappish this day,
because she had lost her big coal.</p>

<p>"I can't have you children come
bothering here," said she, crossly.
"I want to wring out my clothes,
and hang them to dry. Be off with
you!"</p>

<p>"Let us stop a little&mdash;just to tell Gardener this one curious thing
about Dolly and the pig&mdash;and then we'll help you to take your clothes
to the orchard; we can carry your basket between us&mdash;we can, indeed."</p>

<p>That was the last thing the woman wished; for she knew the
that the children would be sure to see the mess on the gravel-walk&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
they were such inquisitive children&mdash;they noticed every thing.
They would want to know all about it, and how the bits of coal came
there. It was very a awkward position. But people who take other
people's property often do find themselves in awkward positions.</p>

<p>"Thank you, young gentlemen," said she, quite politely; "but
indeed the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bakset'">basket</ins> is too heavy for you. However, you may stop
and gossip a little longer with my old man. He likes it."</p>

<p>And, while they were shut up with Gardener in his bedroom, off
she went, carrying the basket on her head, and hung her clothes
carefully out&mdash;the big things on lines between the fruit trees, and the
little things, such as stockings and pocket handkerchiefs, stuck on
the gooseberry-bushes, or spread upon the clean green grass.</p>

<p>"Such a fine day as it is! they'll dry directly," said she, cheerfully,
to herself. "Plenty of sun, and not a breath of wind to blow them
about. I'll leave them for an hour or two, and come and fetch them
in before it grows dark. Then I shall get all my folding done by
bedtime, and have a clear day for ironing to-morrow."</p>

<p>But when she did fetch them in, having bundled them all together
in the dusk of the evening, never was such a sight as those clothes!
They were all twisted in the oddest way&mdash;the stockings turned inside
out, with the heels and toes tucked into the legs; the sleeves of the
shirts tied together in double knots, the pocket-handkerchiefs made
into round balls, so tight that if you had pelted a person with them
they would have given very hard <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bolws'">blows</ins> indeed. And the whole
looked as if, instead of lying quietly on the grass and bushes, they had
been dragged through heaps of mud and then stamped upon, so that
there was not a clean inch upon them from end to end.</p>

<p>"What a horrid mess!" cried the Gardener's wife, who had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at first very angry, and then very frightened. "But I know what it
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it'">is</ins>; that nasty Boxer has got loose again. It's he that has done it."</p>

<p>"Boxer wouldn't tie shirt-sleeves in double knots, or make balls
of pocket-handkerchiefs," Gardener was heard to answer, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Then it's those horrid children; they are always up to some
mischief or other&mdash;just let me catch them!"</p>

<p>"You'd better not," said somebody in a voice exactly like Gardener's,
though he himself declared he had not spoken a word. Indeed,
he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Well, it's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of," the
Gardener's wife said, supposing she was talking to her husband all the
time; but soon she held her tongue, for she found here and there
among the clothes all sorts of queer marks&mdash;marks of fingers, and
toes, and heels, not in mud at all, but in coal-dust, as black as black
could be.</p>

<p>Now, as the place where the big coal had tumbled out of the
barrow was fully fifty yards from the orchard, and, as the coal could
not come to the clothes, and the clothes could not go without hands,
the only conclusion she could arrive at was&mdash;well, no particular
conclusion at all!</p>

<p>It was too late that night to begin washing again; besides, she was
extremely tired, and her husband woke up rather worse than usual,
so she just bundled the clothes up anyhow in a corner, put the kitchen
to rights, and went mournfully to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning she got up long before it was light, washed her
clothes through all over again, and, it being impossible to dry them
by the fire, went out with them once more, and began spreading
them out in their usual corner, in a hopeless and melancholy manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
While she was at it, the little folks came trooping around her. She
didn't scold them this time, she was too low-spirited.</p>

<p>"No! my old man isn't any better, and I don't fancy he ever will
be," said she, in answer to their questions. "And every thing's
going wrong with us&mdash;just listen!" And she told the trick which
had been played her about the clothes.</p>

<p>The little people tried not to laugh, but it was so funny; and even
now, the minute she had done hanging them out, there was something
so droll in the way the clothes blew about, without any wind;
the shirts hanging with their necks <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'donwward'">downward</ins>, as if there was a man
inside them; and the drawers standing stiffly astride on the gooseberry-bushes,
for all the world as if they held a pair of legs still. As
for Gardener's night-caps&mdash;long, white cotton, with a tassel at the
top&mdash;they were alarming to look at; just like a head stuck on the top
of a pole.</p>

<p>The whole thing was so peculiar, and the old woman so comical
in her despair, that the children, after trying hard to keep it in, at
last broke into shouts of laughter. She turned furiously upon them.</p>

<p>"It was you who did it!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed it wasn't!" said they, jumping farther to escape
her blows. For she had got one of her clothes-props, and was laying
about her in the most reckless manner. However, she hurt nobody,
and then she suddenly burst out, not laughing, but crying.</p>

<p>"It's a cruel thing, whoever has done it, to play such tricks on a
poor old body like me, with a sick husband that she works hard for,
and not a child to help her. But I don't care. I'll wash my clothes
again, if it's twenty times over, and I'll hang them out again in the
very place, just to make you all ashamed of yourselves."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the little people were ashamed of themselves, though
they really had not done the mischief. But they knew quite well
who had done it, and more than once they were about to tell; only
they were afraid, if they did so, they should vex the Brownie so much
that he would never come and play with them any more.</p>

<p>So they looked at one another without speaking, and when the Gardener's
wife had emptied her basket and dried her eyes, they said
to her, very kindly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps no harm may come to your clothes this time. We'll
sit and watch them till they are dry."</p>

<p>"Just as you like; I don't care. Them that hides can find, and
them that plays tricks knows how to stop 'em."</p>

<p>It was not a civil speech, but then things were hard for the poor old
woman. She had been awake nearly all night, and up washing at
daybreak; her eyes were red with crying, and her steps weary and
slow. The little children felt quite sorry for her, and, instead of
going to play, sat watching the clothes as patiently as possible.</p>

<p>Nothing came near them. Sometimes, as before, the things seemed
to dance about without hands, and turn into odd shapes, as if there
were people inside them; but not a creature was seen and not a sound
was heard. And though there was neither wind nor sun, very soon
all the linen was perfectly dry.</p>

<p>"Fetch one of mother's baskets, and we'll fold it up as tidily as
possible&mdash;that is, the girls can do it, it's their business&mdash;and we boys
will carry it safe to Gardener's cottage."</p>

<p>So said they, not liking to say that they could not trust it out of
their sight for fear of Brownie, whom, indeed, they were expecting
to see peer round from every bush. They began to have a secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
fear that he was rather a naughty Brownie; but then, as the eldest
little girl whispered, "He was only a Brownie, and knew no better."
Now they were growing quite big children, who would be men and
women some time; when they hoped they would never do any thing
wrong. (Their parents hoped the same, but doubted it.)</p>

<p>In a serious and careful manner they folded up the clothes, and
laid them one by one in the basket without any mischief, until, just
as the two biggest boys were lifting their burden to carry it away,
they felt something tugging at it from underneath.</p>

<p>"Halloo! Where are you taking all this rubbish? Better give
it to me."</p>

<p>"No, if you please," said they, very civilly, not to offend the little
brown man. "We'll not trouble you, thanks! We'd rather do it
ourselves; for poor Gardener is very ill, and his wife is very miserable,
and we are extremely sorry for them both."</p>

<p>"Extremely sorry!" cried Brownie, throwing up his cap in the
air, and tumbling head over heels in an excited manner. "What
in the world does extremely sorry mean?"</p>

<p>The children could not explain, especially to a Brownie; but they
thought they understood&mdash;anyhow, they felt it. And they looked so
sorrowful that the Brownie could not tell what to make of it.</p>

<p>He could not be said to be sorry, since, being a Brownie, and not
a human being, knowing right from wrong, he never tried particularly
to do right, and had no idea that he was doing wrong. But he seemed
to have an idea that he was troubling the children, and he never liked
to see them look unhappy.</p>

<p>So he turned head over heels six times running, and then came
back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"The silly old woman! I washed her clothes for her last night
in a way she didn't expect. I hadn't any soap, so I used a little
mud and coal-dust, and very pretty they looked. Ha, ha, ha! Shall
I wash them over again to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, please don't!" implored the children.</p>

<p>"Shall I starch and iron them? I'll do it beautifully. One&mdash;two&mdash;three,
five&mdash;six&mdash;seven, Abracadabra, tum&mdash;tum&mdash;ti!" shouted
he, jabbering all sorts of nonsense, as it seemed to the children, and
playing such antics that they stood and stared in the utmost amazement,
and quite forgot the clothes. When they looked round again,
the basket was gone.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Seek till you find, seek till you find,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Under the biggest gooseberry-bush, exactly to your mind."</span><br />
</div>

<p>They heard him singing this remarkable rhyme, long after they
had lost sight of him. And then they all set about searching; but it
was a long while before they found, and still longer before they could
decide, which was the biggest gooseberry-bush, each child having
his or her opinion&mdash;sometimes a very strong one&mdash;on the matter.
At last they agreed to settle it by pulling half-a-dozen little sticks,
to see which stick was the longest, and the child that held it was to
decide the gooseberry-bush.</p>

<p>This done, underneath the branches what should they find but
the identical basket of clothes! only, instead of being roughly dried,
they were all starched and ironed in the most beautiful manner. As
for the shirts, they really were a picture to behold, and the stockings
were all folded up, and even darned in one or two places, as neatly
as possible. And strange to tell, there was not a single black mark
of feet or fingers on any one of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kind little Brownie! clever little Brownie!" cried the children
in chorus, and thought this was the most astonishing trick he had
ever played.</p>

<p>What the Gardener's wife said about it, whether they told her any
thing, or allowed her to suppose that the clothes had been done in
their own laundry instead of the Brownie's (wherever that establishment
might be), is more than I can tell. Of one thing only I am
certain&mdash;that the little people said nothing but what was true. Also,
that the very minute they got home they told their mother every thing.</p>

<p>But for a long time after that they were a good deal troubled.
Gardener got better, and went hobbling about the place again, to
his own and every body's great content, and his wife was less sharp-tongued
and complaining than usual&mdash;indeed, she had nothing to
complain of. All the family were very flourishing, except the little
Brownie.</p>

<p>Often there was heard a curious sound all over the house; it might
have been rats squeaking behind the wainscot&mdash;the elders said it
was&mdash;but the children were sure it was a sort of weeping and wailing.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"They've stolen my coal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And I haven't a hole</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To hide in;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Not even a house</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One could ask a mouse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To bide in."</span><br />
</div>

<p>A most forlorn tune it was, ending in a dreary minor key, and it
lasted for months and months&mdash;at least the children said it did.
And they were growing quite dull for want of a playfellow, when,
by the greatest good luck in the world, there came to the house not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
only a new lot of kittens, but a new baby. And the new baby was
everybody's pet, including the Brownie's.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="The new baby was everybody&#39;s pet.&mdash;Page 87" title="" />
<span class="caption">The new baby was everybody&#39;s pet.&mdash;Page 87</span>
</div>

<p>From that time, though he was not often seen, he was continually
heard up and down the staircase, where he was frequently mistaken
for Tiny or the cat, and sent sharply down again, which was wasting
a great deal of wholesome anger upon Mr. Nobody. Or he lurked
in odd corners of the nursery, whither the baby was seen crawling
eagerly after nothing in particular, or sitting laughing with all her
might at something&mdash;probably her own toes.</p>

<p>But, as Brownie was never seen, he was never suspected. And
since he did no mischief&mdash;neither pinched the baby nor broke the
toys, left no soap in the bath and no footmarks about the room&mdash;but
was always a well-conducted Brownie in every way, he was
allowed to inhabit the nursery (or supposed to do so, since, as nobody
saw him, nobody could prevent him), until the children were grown
up into men and women.</p>

<p>After that he retired into his coal-cellar, and, for all I know, he
may live there still, and have gone through hundreds of adventures
since; but as I never heard them, I can't tell them. Only I think,
if I could be a little child again, I should exceedingly like a Brownie
to play with me. Should not you?</p>

<h3>THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.</h3>


<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">A slender</span> young Blackbird built in a thorn-tree<br />
A spruce little fellow as ever could be;<br />
His bill was so yellow, his feathers so black,<br />
So long was his tail, and so glossy his back,<br />
That good Mrs. B., who sat hatching her eggs,<br />
And only just left them to stretch her poor legs,<br />
And pick for a minute the worm she preferred,<br />
Thought there never was seen such a beautiful bird.<br />
<br />
And such a kind husband! how early and late<br />
He would sit at the top of the old garden gate,<br />
And sing, just as merry as if it were June,<br />
Being ne'er out of patience, or temper, or tune.<br />
"So unlike those Rooks, dear; from morning till night<br />
They seem to do nothing but quarrel and fight,<br />
And wrangle and jangle, and plunder&mdash;while we<br />
Sit, honest and safe, in our pretty thorn-tree."<br />
<br />
Just while she was speaking, a lively young Rook<br />
Alit with a flap that the thorn-bush quite shook,<br />
And seizing a stick from the nest&mdash;"Come, I say,<br />
That will just suit me, neighbor"&mdash;flew with it away<br />
The lady loud twittered&mdash;her husband soon heard:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Though peaceful, he was not a cowardly bird;<br />
And with arguments angry enough to o'erwhelm<br />
A whole Rookery&mdash;flew to the top of the elm.<br />
<br />
"How dare you, you&mdash;" (thief he was going to say;<br />
But a civiller sentiment came in the way:<br />
For he knew 'tis no good, and it anyhow shames<br />
A gentleman, calling strange gentlemen names:)<br />
"Pray what is your motive, Sir Rook, for such tricks,<br />
As building your mansion with other folks' sticks?<br />
I request you'll restore them, in justice and law."<br />
At which the whole colony set up a&mdash;caw!<br />
<br />
But Blackbird, not silenced, then spoke out again;<br />
"I've built my small nest with much labor and pain.<br />
I'm a poor singing gentleman, Sirs, it is true,<br />
Though cockneys do often mistake me for you;<br />
But I keep Mrs. Blackbird, and four little eggs,<br />
And neither e'er pilfers, or borrows, or begs.<br />
Now have I not right on my side, do you see?"<br />
But they flew at and pecked him all down the elm-tree.<br />
<br />
Ah! wickedness prospers sometimes, I much fear;<br />
And virtue's not always victorious, that's clear:<br />
At least, not at first: for it must be confessed<br />
Poor Blackbird lost many a stick from his nest;<br />
And his unkind grand neighbors with scoffing caw-caws,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>In his voice and his character found many flaws,<br />
And jeered him and mocked him; but when they'd all done,<br />
He flew to his tree and sang cheerily on.<br />
<br />
At length May arrived with her garlands of leaves;<br />
The swallows were building beneath the farm-eaves,<br />
Wrens, linnets, and sparrows, on every hedge-side,<br />
Were bringing their families out with great pride;<br />
While far above all, on the tallest tree-top,<br />
With a flutter and clamor that never did stop,<br />
The haughty old Rooks held their heads up so high,<br />
And dreamed not of trouble&mdash;until it drew nigh!<br />
<br />
One morning at seven, as he came with delight<br />
To his wife's pretty parlor of may-blossoms white,<br />
Having fed all his family ere rise of sun,&mdash;<br />
Mr. Blackbird perceived&mdash;a big man with a gun;<br />
Who also perceived him: "See, Charlie, among<br />
That may, sits the Blackbird we've heard for so long:<br />
Most likely his nest's there&mdash;how frightened he looks!<br />
Nay, Blackie, we're not come for you, but the Rooks."<br />
<br />
I don't say 'twas cruel&mdash;I can't say 'twas kind&mdash;<br />
On the subject I haven't quite made up my mind:<br />
But those guns went pop-popping all morning, alas!<br />
And young Rooks kept dropping among the long grass,<br />
Till good Mr. Blackbird, who watched the whole thing,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>For pity could scarcely a single note sing,<br />
And in the May sunset he hardly could bear<br />
To hear the returning Rooks' caw of despair.<br />
<br />
"O, dear Mrs. Blackbird," at last warbled he,<br />
"How happy we are in our humble thorn-tree;<br />
How gaily we live, living honest and poor,<br />
How sweet are the may-blossoms over our door."<br />
"And then our dear children," the mother replied,<br />
And she nested them close to her warm feathered side,<br />
And with a soft twitter of drowsy content,<br />
In the quiet May moonlight to sleep they all went.<br />

<h3><br />THE SHAKING OF THE PEAR-TREE</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Of</span> all days I remember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In summers passed away,</span><br />
Was "the shaking of the pear-tree,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In grandma's orchard gay.</span><br />
<br />
A large old-fashioned orchard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With long grass under foot,</span><br />
And blackberry-brambles crawling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In many a tangled shoot.</span><br />
<br />
From cherry time, till damsons<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dropped from the branches sere,</span><br />
That wonderful old orchard<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was full of fruit all year;</span><br />
<br />
We pick'd it up in baskets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or pluck'd it from the wall;</span><br />
But the shaking of the pear-tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the grandest treat of all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Long, long the days we counted</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Until that day drew nigh;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Then, how we watched the sun set,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And criticised the sky!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">If rain&mdash;"'Twill clear at midnight;"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">If dawn broke chill and gray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"O many a cloudy morning</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Turns out a lovely day."</span><br />
<br />
So off we started gaily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heedless of jolt or jar;</span><br />
Through town and lane, and hamlet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In old Llewellyn's car.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He's dead and gone&mdash;Llewellyn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">These twenty years, I doubt:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">If I put him in this poem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He'll never find it out,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The patient, kind Llewellyn&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Whose broad face smiled all o'er,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">As he lifted out us children</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">At grandma's very door.</span><br />
<br />
And there stood Grandma's Betty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With cheeks like apples red;</span><br />
And Dash, the spaniel, waddled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of his cosy bed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With silky ears down dropping,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And coat of chestnut pale;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He was so fat and lazy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He scarce could wag his tail.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Poor Dash is dead, and buried</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Under the lilac-tree;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And Betty's old,&mdash;as, children,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">We all may one day be.</span><br />
<br />
I hope no child will vex us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As we vexed Betty then,</span><br />
With winding up the draw-well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or hunting the old hen.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And teasing, teasing, teasing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Till afternoon wore round,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And shaken pears came tumbling</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In showers upon the ground.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">O how we jumped and shouted!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O how we plunged amid</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The long grass, where the treasures,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Dropped down and deftly hid;</span><br />
<br />
Long, slender-shaped, red-russet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or yellow just like gold;</span><br />
Ah! never pears have tasted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like those sweet pears of old!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We ate&mdash;I'd best not mention</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">How many: paused to fill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Big basket after basket;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Working with right good-will;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Then hunted round the orchard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">For half-ripe plums&mdash;in vain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">So, back unto the pear-tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To eat, and eat again.</span><br />
<br />
I'm not on my confession,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therefore need not say</span><br />
How tired, and cross, and sleepy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some were ere close of day;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For pleasure has its ending,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And eke its troubles too;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which you'll find out, my children,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As well as we could do.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But yet this very minute,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I seem to see it all&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The pear-tree's empty branches</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The gray of evening-fall;</span><br />
<br />
The children's homeward silence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The furnace fires that glowed,</span><br />
Each mile or so, out streaming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across the lonely road;</span><br />
<br />
And high, high set in heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One large bright, beauteous star,</span><br />
That shone between the curtains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of old Llewellyn's car.</span><br />

<h3><br />THE WONDERFUL APPLE-TREE.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h3>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">Come</span> here, my dear boys, and I'll tell you a fable,<br />
Which you may believe as much as you're able;<br />
It isn't all true, nor all false, I'll be bound&mdash;<br />
Of the tree that bears apples all the year round.<br />
<br />
There was a Dean Tucker of Gloster city,<br />
Who may have been wise, or worthy, or witty;<br />
But I know nothing of him, the more's the pity,<br />
Save that he was Dean Tucker of Gloster city.<br />
<br />
And walking one day with a musing air<br />
In his Deanery garden, close by where<br />
The great cathedral's west window's seen,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>"I'll plant an apple," said Tucker the Dean.<br />
<br />
The apple was planted, the apple grew,<br />
A stout young tree, full of leaves not few;<br />
The apple was grafted, the apple bore<br />
Of goodly apples, one, two, three, four.<br />
<br />
The old Dean walked in his garden fair,<br />
"I'm glad I planted that young tree there,<br />
Though it was but a shoot, or some old tree's sucker;<br />
I'll taste it to-morrow," said good Dean Tucker.<br />
<br />
But lo, in the night when (they say) trees talk,<br />
And some of the liveliest get up and walk,<br />
With fairies abroad for watch and warden&mdash;<br />
There was such a commotion in the Dean's garden!<br />
<br />
"I will not be gathered," the apple-tree said,<br />
"Was it for this I blossomed so red?<br />
Hung out my fruit all the summer days,<br />
Got so much sunshine, and pleasure and praise?"<br />
<br />
"Ah!" interrupted a solemn red plum,<br />
"This is the end to which all of us come;<br />
Last month I was laden with hundreds&mdash;but now"&mdash;<br />
And he sighed the last little plum off from his bough.<br />
<br />
"Nay, friend, take it easy," the pear-tree replied<br />
(A lady-like person against the wall-side).<br />
"Man guards, nurtures, trains us from top down to root:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>I think 'tis but fair we should give him our fruit."<br />
<br />
"No, I'll not be gathered," the apple resumed,<br />
And shook his young branches, and fluttered and fumed;<br />
"And I'll not drop neither, as some of you drop,<br />
Over-ripe: I'm determined to keep my whole crop.<br />
<br />
"And I with"&mdash;O'er his branches just then <i>something</i> flew;<br />
It seemed like moth, large and grayish of hue.<br />
But it was a Fairy. Her voice soft did sound,<br />
"Be the tree that bears apples all the year round."<br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class='poem2'>
The Dean to his apple-tree, came, full of hope,<br />
But tough was the fruit-stalk as double-twist rope,<br />
And when he had cut it with patience and pain,<br />
He bit just one mouthful&mdash;and never again.<br />
<br />
"An apple so tasteless, so juiceless, so hard,<br />
Is, sure, good for nought but to bowl in the yard;<br />
The choir-boys may have it." But choir-boys soon found<br />
It was worthless&mdash;the tree that bore all the year round.<br />
<br />
And Gloster lads climbing the Deanery wall<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Were punished, as well might all young <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'theives'">thieves</ins> appal,<br />
For, clutching the booty for which they did sin,<br />
They bit at the apples&mdash;and left their teeth in!<br />
<br />
And thus all the year from October till May,<br />
From May till October, the apples shone gay;<br />
But 'twas just outside glitter, for no hand was found<br />
To pluck at the fruit which hung all the year round.<br />
<br />
And so till they rotted, those queer apples hung,<br />
The bare boughs and blossoms and ripe fruit among<br />
And in Gloster city it still may be found&mdash;<br />
The tree that bears apples all the year round.<br />

<h3><br />THE JEALOUS BOY</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">What</span>, my little foolish Ned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Think you mother's eyes are blind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That her heart has grown unkind,</span><br />
And she will not turn her head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cannot see, for all her joy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her poor jealous little boy?</span><br />
<br />
What though sister be the pet&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laughs, and leaps, and clings, and loves,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With her eyes as soft as dove's&mdash;</span><br />
Why should yours with tears be wet?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why such angry tears let fall?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mother's heart has room for all.</span><br />
<br />
Mother's heart is very wide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And its doors all open stand:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lightest touch of tiniest hand</span><br />
She will never put aside.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why her happiness destroy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foolish, naughty, jealous boy?</span><br />
<br />
Come within the circle bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where we laugh, and dance, and sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full of love to everything;</span><br />
As God loves us, day and night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>forgives</i> us. Come&mdash;with joy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mother too forgives her boy.</span><br />

<h3><br />THE STORY OF THE BIRKENHEAD</h3>

<h4>TOLD TO TWO CHILDREN</h4>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">And</span> so you want <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fairy a'">a fairy</ins> tale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My little maidens twain?</span><br />
Well, sit beside the waterfall,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Noisy with last night's rain;</span><br />
<br />
On couch of moss, with elfin spears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bristling, all fierce to see,</span><br />
When from the yet brown moor down drops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lonely April bee.</span><br />
<br />
All the wide valley blushes green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While, in far depths below,</span><br />
Wharfe flashes out a great bright eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hides his shining flow;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Wharfe, busy, restless, rapid Wharfe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glory of our dale;</span><br />
O I could of the River Wharfe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell such a fairy tale!</span><br />
<br />
"The Boy of Egremond," you cry,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And all the 'bootless bene:'</span><br />
We know that poem, every word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we the Strid have seen."</span><br />
<br />
No, clever damsels: though the tale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seems still to bear a part,</span><br />
In every lave of Wharfe's bright wave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The broken mother's heart&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Little you know of broken hearts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My Kitty, blithe and wise,</span><br />
Grave Mary, with the woman soul<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dawning through childish eyes.</span><br />
<br />
And long, long distant may God keep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day when each shall know</span><br />
The entrance to His kingdom through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His baptism of woe!</span><br />
<br />
But yet 'tis good to hear of grief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which He permits to be;</span><br />
Even as in our green inland home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We talk of wrecks at sea.</span><br />
<br />
So on this lovely day, when spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wakes soft o'er moor and dale,</span><br />
I'll tell&mdash;not quite your wish&mdash;but yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A noble "fairy" tale.</span><br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class='poem'>
'Twas six o'clock in the morning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sea like crystal lay,</span><br />
When the good troop-ship Birkenhead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set sail from Simon's Bay.</span><br />
<br />
The Cape of Good Hope on her right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gloomed at her through the noon:</span><br />
Brief tropic twilight fled, and night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell suddenly and soon.</span><br />
<br />
At eight o'clock in the evening<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dim grew the pleasant land;</span><br />
O'er smoothest seas the southern heaven<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its starry arch out-spanned.</span><br />
<br />
The soldiers on the bulwarks leaned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smoked, chatted; and below</span><br />
The soldiers' wives sang babes to sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While on the ship sailed slow.</span><br />
<br />
Six hundred and thirty souls held she,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good, bad, old, young, rich, poor;</span><br />
Six hundred and thirty living souls&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God knew them all.&mdash;Secure</span><br />
<br />
He counted them in His right hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That held the hungering seas;</span><br />
And to four hundred came a voice&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The Master hath need of these."</span><br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class='poem'>
On, onward, still the vessel went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till, with a sudden shock,</span><br />
Like one that's clutched by unseen Death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She struck upon a rock.</span><br />
<br />
She filled. Not hours, not minutes left;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each second a life's gone:</span><br />
Drowned in their berths, washed overboard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lost, swimming, one by one;</span><br />
<br />
Till, o'er this chaos of despair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rose, like celestial breath,</span><br />
The law of order, discipline,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Obedience unto death.</span><br />
<br />
The soldiers mustered upon deck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As mute as on parade;</span><br />
"Women and children to the boats!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not a man gainsayed.</span><br />
<br />
Without a murmur or a moan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stood, formed rank and file,</span><br />
Between the dreadful crystal seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sky's dreadful smile.</span><br />
<br />
In face of death they did their work<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they in life would do,</span><br />
Embarking at a quiet quay&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A quiet, silent crew.</span><br />
<br />
"Now each man for himself. To the boats!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arose a passing cry.</span><br />
The soldier-captain answered, "Swamp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The women and babes?&mdash;No, die!"</span><br />
<br />
And so they died. Each in his place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Obedient to command,</span><br />
They went down with the sinking ship,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went down in sight of land.</span><br />
<br />
The great sea oped her mouth, and closed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er them. Awhile they trod</span><br />
The valley of the shadow of death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then were safe with God.</span><br />

Nay, dry them. If we could but see<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the eternal Dark.</span><br />
<br />
But yet we know that all is well<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That He, who loved all these,</span><br />
Loves children laughing on the moor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Birds singing in the trees;</span><br />
<br />
That He who made both life and death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He knoweth which is best:</span><br />
We live to Him, we die to Him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leave Him all the rest.</span><br />

<h3><br />THE LITTLE COMFORTER</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"<span class="smcap">What</span> is wrong with my big brother?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Says the child;</span><br />
For they two had got no mother<br />
And she loved him like no other:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">If he smiled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">All the world seemed bright and gay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">To this happy little May.</span><br />
<br />
If to her he sharply spoke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This big brother&mdash;</span><br />
Then her tender heart nigh broke;<br />
But the cruel pain that woke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">She would smother&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">As a little woman can;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Was he not almost a man?</span><br />
<br />
But when trouble or disgrace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Smote the boy,</span><br />
She would lift her gentle face&mdash;<br />
Surely 'twas her own right place.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">To bring joy?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">For she loved him&mdash;loved him so!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Whether he was good or no</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">May be he will never feel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Half her love;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wound her, and forget to heal:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Idle words are sharp as steel:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">But above,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I know what the angels say</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Of this silent little May.</span><br />
</div>


<h3><br />DON'T BE AFRAID.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Don't</span> be afraid of the dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My daughter, dear as my soul!</span><br />
You see but a part of the gloomy world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I&mdash;I have seen the whole,</span><br />
And I know each step of the fearsome way,<br />
Till the shadows brighten to open day.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid of pain,<br />
My tender little child:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When its smart is worst there comes strength to bear,</span><br />
And it seems as if angels smiled,&mdash;<br />
As I smile, dear, when I hurt you now.<br />
In binding up that wound on your brow.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid of grief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twill come&mdash;as night follows day,</span><br />
But the bleakest sky has tiny rifts<br />
When the stars shine through&mdash;as to say<br />
Wait, wait a little&mdash;till night is o'er<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>And beautiful day come back once more.<br />
<br />
O child, be afraid of sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But have no other fear,</span><br />
For God's in the dark, as well as the light;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And while we can feel Him near,</span><br />
His hand that He gives, His love that He gave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lead safely, even to the dark of the grave.</span><br />

<h3><br />GIRL AND BOY</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> is gentle as a girl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Judith longs to be a boy!</span><br />
Would cut off every pretty curl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With eager joy!</span><br />
<br />
Hates to be called "my dear"&mdash;or kissed:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For dollies does not care one fig:</span><br />
Goes, sticking hands up to the wrist<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In jackets big.</span><br />
<br />
Would like to do whate'er boy can;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Play cricket&mdash;even to go school:</span><br />
It is so grand to be a man!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A girl's a fool!</span><br />
<br />
But Alfred smiles superior love<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On all these innocent vagaries.</span><br />
He'd hate a goose! but yet a dove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, much more rare is!</span><br />
<br />
She's anything but dove, good sooth!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she's his dear and only sister:</span><br />
And, had she been a boy, in truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How he'd have missed her.</span><br />
<br />
So, gradually her folly dies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she'll consent to be just human,</span><br />
When there shines out of girlish eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The real Woman.</span><br />
</div>


<h3><br />AGNES AT PRAYER</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"<span class="smcap">Our</span> Father which art in heaven,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Little Agnes prays,</span><br />
Though her kneeling is but show,<br />
Though she is too young to know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All, or half she says.</span><br />
God will hear her, Agnes mild,<br />
God will love the innocent child.<br />
<br />
"Our Father which art in heaven."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She has a father here,</span><br />
Does she think of his kind eyes,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Tones that ne'er in anger rise&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Yes, dear," or "No, dear."</span><br />
They will haunt her whole life long<br />
Like a sweet pathetic song.<br />
<br />
"Our Father which art in heaven,"<br />
Through thy peaceful prayer,<br />
Think of the known father's face,<br />
Of his bosom, happy place;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Safely sheltered there;</span><br />
And so blessed&mdash;long may He bless!<br />
Think too of the fatherless.<br />

<h3><br />GOING TO WORK</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Come</span> along for the work is ready&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rough it may be, rough, tough and hard&mdash;</span><br />
But&mdash;fourteen years old&mdash;stout, strong and steady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Life's game's beginning, lad!&mdash;play your card&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Come along.</span><br />
<br />
Mother stands at the door-step crying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well but she has a brave heart too:</span><br />
She'll try to be glad&mdash;there's nought like trying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She's proud of having a son like you.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Come along.</span><br />
<br />
Young as she is, her hair is whitening,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She has ploughed thro' years of sorrow deep,</span><br />
She looks at her boy, and her eyes are brightening,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shame if ever you make them weep!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come along.</span><br />
<br />
Bravo! See how the brown cheek flushes!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ready to work as hard as you can?</span><br />
I have always faith in a boy that blushes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">None will blush for him, when he's a man.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come along.</span><br />
</div>


<h3><br />THREE COMPANIONS</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">We</span> go on our way together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Baby, and dog, and I;</span><br />
Three merry companions,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath any sort of sky;</span><br />
Blue as her pretty eyes are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or gray, like his dear old tail;</span><br />
Be it windy, or cloudy, or stormy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our courage does never fail.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes the snow lies thickly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the hedge-row bleak;</span><br />
Then baby cries "Pretty, pretty,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The only word she can speak.</span><br />
Sometimes two rivers of water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Run down the muddy lane;</span><br />
Then dog leaps backwards and forwards<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Barking with might and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ma n'">main</ins>.</span><br />
<br />
Baby's a little lady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dog is a gentleman brave:</span><br />
If he had two legs as you have<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd kneel to her like a slave;</span><br />
As it is he loves and protects her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As dog and gentleman can;</span><br />
I'd rather be a kind doggie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I think, than a brute of a man.</span><br />
</div>


<h3><br />THE MOTHERLESS CHILD</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">She</span> was going home down the lonely street,<br />
A widow-woman with weary feet<br />
And weary eyes that seldom smiled:<br />
She had neither mother, sister, nor child.<br />
She earned her bread with a patient heart,<br />
And ate it quietly and apart,<br />
In her silent home from day to day,<br />
No one to say her "ay," or "nay."<br />
<br />
She was going home without care to haste;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>What should she haste for? On she paced<br />
Through the snowy night so bleak and wild,<br />
When she thought she heard the cry of a child,<br />
A feeble cry, not of hunger or pain,<br />
But just of sorrow. It came again.<br />
She stopped&mdash;she listened&mdash;she almost smiled&mdash;<br />
"That sounds like a wail of a motherless child."<br />
<br />
A house stood open&mdash;no soul was there&mdash;<br />
Her dull, tired feet grew light on the stair;<br />
She mounted&mdash;entered. One bed on the floor,<br />
And Something in it: and close by the door,<br />
Watching the stark form, stretched out still,<br />
Ignorant knowing not good nor ill,<br />
But only a want and a misery wild,<br />
Crouched the dead mother's motherless child.<br />
<br />
What next? Come say what would you have done<br />
Dear children playing about in the sun,<br />
Or sitting by pleasant fireside warm,<br />
Hearing outside the howling storm?<br />
The widow went in and she shut the door,<br />
She stayed by the dead an hour or more&mdash;<br />
And when she went home through the night so wild,<br />
She had in her arms a sleeping child.<br />
<br />
Now she is old and feeble and dull,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>But her empty heart is happy and full<br />
If her crust be hard and her cottage poor<br />
There's a young foot tripping across the floor,<br />
Young hands to help her that never tire,<br />
And a young voice singing beside the fire;<br />
And her tired eyes look as if they smiled,&mdash;<br />
Childless mother and motherless child.<br />

<h3><br />THE WREN'S NEST</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">I took</span> the wren's nest;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heaven forgive me!</span><br />
Its merry architects so small<br />
Had scarcely finished their wee hall,<br />
That empty still and neat and fair<br />
Hung idly in the summer air.<br />
The mossy walls, the dainty door,<br />
Where Love should enter and explore,<br />
And Love sit caroling outside,<br />
And Love within chirp multiplied;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I took the wren's nest;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heaven forgive me!</span><br />
<br />
How many hours of happy pains<br />
Through early frosts and April rains,<br />
How many songs at eve and morn<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>O'er springing grass and greening corn,<br />
Before the pretty house was made!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I took the wren's nest;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bird, forgive me!</span><br />
<br />
Thou and thy mate, sans let, sans fear,<br />
Ye have before you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'al'">all</ins> the year,<br />
And every wood holds nooks for you,<br />
In which to sing and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bui d'">build</ins> and woo<br />
One piteous cry of birdish pain&mdash;<br />
And ye'll begin your life again,<br />
Forgetting quite the lost, lost home<br />
In many a busy home to come&mdash;<br />
But I?&mdash;Your wee house keep I must<br />
Until it crumble into <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'du t'">dust</ins>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I took the wren's nest:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God forgive me!</span><br />

<h3><br />A CHILD'S <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'SMIL'">SMILE</ins></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">A child's</span> smile&mdash;nothing more;<br />
Quiet and soft and grave, and seldom seen,<br />
Like summer lightning o'er,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Leaving the little face again serene.<br />
<br />
I think, boy well-beloved,<br />
Thine angel, who did grieve to see how far<br />
Thy childhood is removed<br />
From sports that dear to other children are,<br />
<br />
On this pale cheek has thrown<br />
The brightness of his countenance, and made<br />
A beauty like his own&mdash;<br />
That, while we see it, we are half afraid,<br />
<br />
And marvel, will it stay?<br />
Or, long ere manhood, will that angel fair,<br />
Departing some sad day,<br />
Steal the child-smile and leave the shadow care?<br />
<br />
Nay, fear not. As is given<br />
Unto this child the father watching o'er,<br />
His angel up in heaven<br />
Beholds Our Father's face for evermore.<br />
<br />
And he will help him bear<br />
His burthen, as his father helps him now;<br />
So he may come to wear<br />
That happy child-smile on an old man's brow.<br />

<h3><br />OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">A little</span> bird flew my window by,<br />
'Twixt the level street and the level sky,<br />
The level rows of houses tall,<br />
The long low sun on the level wall<br />
And all that the little bird did say<br />
Was, "Over the hills and far away."<br />
<br />
A little bird sang behind my chair,<br />
From the level line of corn-fields fair,<br />
The smooth green <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hedgegrow's'">hedgerow's</ins> level bound<br />
Not a furlong off&mdash;the horizon's bound,<br />
And the level lawn where the sun all day<br />
Burns:&mdash;"Over the hills and far away."<br />
<br />
A little bird sings above my bed,<br />
And I know if I could but lift my head<br />
I would see the sun set, round and grand,<br />
Upon level sea and level sand,<br />
While beyond the misty distance gray<br />
Is "Over the hills and far away."<br />
<br />
I think that a little bird will sing<br />
Over a grassy mound, next spring,<br />
Where something that once was <i>me</i>, ye'll leave<br />
In the level sunshine, morn and eve:<br />
But I shall be gone, past night, past day,<br />
Over the hills and far away.<br />

<h3><br />THE TWO RAINDROPS</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Said</span> a drop to a drop, "Just look at me!<br />
I'm the finest rain-drop you ever did see:<br />
I have lived ten seconds at least on my pane;<br />
Swelling and filling and swelling again.<br />
<br />
"All the little rain-drops unto me run,<br />
I watch them and catch them and suck them up each one:<br />
All the pretty children stand and at me stare;<br />
Pointing with their fingers&mdash;'That's the biggest drop there.'"<br />
<br />
"Yet you are but a drop," the small drop replied;<br />
"I don't myself see much cause for pride:<br />
The bigger you swell up,&mdash;we know well, my friend,&mdash;<br />
The faster you run down the sooner you'll end.<br />
<br />
"For me, I'm contented outside on my ledge,<br />
Hearing the patter of rain in the hedge;<br />
Looking at the firelight and the children fair,&mdash;<br />
Whether they look at me, I'm sure I don't care."<br />
<br />
"Sir," cried the first drop, "your talk is but dull;<br />
I can't wait to listen, for I'm almost full;<br />
You'll run a race with me?&mdash;No?&mdash;Then 'tis plain<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>I am the largest drop in the whole pane."<br />
<br />
Off ran the big drop, at first rather slow:<br />
Then faster and faster, as drops will, you know:<br />
Raced down the window-pane, like hundreds before,<br />
Just reached the window-sill&mdash;one splash&mdash;and was o'er.<br />

<h3><br />THE YEAR'S END</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">So</span> grows the rising year, and so declines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By months, weeks, days, unto its peaceful end</span><br />
Even as by slow and ever-varying signs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through childhood, youth, our solemn steps we bend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up to the crown of life, and thence descend.</span><br />
<br />
Great Father, who of every one takest care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From him on whom full ninety years are piled</span><br />
To the young babe, just taught to lisp a prayer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who children loves, being once himself a child,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
O make us day by day like Him to grow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More pure and good, more dutiful and meek;</span><br />
Because He loves those who obey Him so;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because His love is the best thing to seek,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because without His love, all loves are weak,&mdash;</span><br />

All earthly joys are miserable and poor,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All earthly goodness quickly droops and dies,</span><br />
Like rootless flowers you plant in gardens&mdash;sure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they will flourish&mdash;till in mid-day skies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun burns, and they fade before your eyes.</span><br />
<br />
O God, who art alone the life and light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of this strange world to which as babes we come,</span><br />
Keep Thou us always children in Thy sight:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guide us from year to year, thro' shine and gloom</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And at our year's end, Father, take us home.</span><br />

<h3><br />RUNNING AFTER THE RAINBOW</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"<span class="smcap">Why</span> thus aside your playthings throw,<br />
Over the wet lawn hurrying so?<br />
Where are you going, I want to know?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm running after the rainbow."</span><br />
<br />
"Little boy, with your bright brown eyes<br />
Full of an innocent surprise,<br />
Stop a minute, my Arthur wise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What do you want with the rainbow?"</span><br />
<br />
Arthur paused in his headlong race,<br />
Turned to his mother his hot, young face,<br />
"Mother, I want to reach the place<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">At either end of the rainbow.</span><br />
<br />
"Nurse says, wherever it meets the ground.<br />
Such beautiful things may oft be found<br />
Buried below, or scattered round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If one can but catch the rainbow.</span><br />
<br />
"O please don't hinder me, mother dear,<br />
It will all be gone while I stay here;"<br />
So with many a hope and not one fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The child ran after the rainbow.</span><br />
<br />
Over the damp grass, ankle deep,<br />
Clambering up the hilly steep,<br />
And the wood where the birds were going to sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he couldn't catch the rainbow.</span><br />
<br />
And when he came out at the wood's far side,<br />
The sun was setting in golden pride,<br />
There were plenty of clouds all rainbow dyed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But not a sign of the rainbow.</span><br />
<br />
Said Arthur, sobbing, as home he went,<br />
"I wish I had thought what mother meant;<br />
I wish I had only been content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not ran after the rainbow."</span><br />
<br />
And as he came sadly down the hill,<br />
Stood mother scolding&mdash;but smiling still,<br />
And hugged him up close, as mothers will:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So he quite forgot the rainbow.</span><br />

<h3><br />DICK AND I</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">We're</span> going to a party, my brother Dick and I:<br />
The best, grandest party we ever did try:<br />
And I'm very happy&mdash;but Dick is so shy!<br />
<br />
I've got a white ball-dress, and flowers in my hair,<br />
And a scarf, with a brooch too, mamma let me wear:<br />
Silk stockings, and shoes with high heels, I declare!<br />
<br />
There is to be music&mdash;a real soldier's band:<br />
And <i>I</i> mean to waltz, and eat ice, and be fanned,<br />
Like a grown-up young lady, the first in the land.<br />
<br />
But Dick is so stupid, so silent and shy:<br />
Has never learnt dancing, so says he won't try&mdash;<br />
Yet Dick is both older and wiser than I.<br />
<br />
And I'm fond of my brother&mdash;this darling old Dick:<br />
I'll hunt him in corners wherever he stick,<br />
He's bad at a party&mdash;but at school he's a brick!<br />
<br />
So good at his Latin, at cricket, football,<br />
Whatever he tries at. And then he's so tall!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Yet at play with the children he's best of us all.<br />
<br />
And his going to the party is just to please <i>me</i>,<br />
Poor Dick! so good-natured. How dull he will be!<br />
But he says I shall dance "like a wave o' the sea."<br />
<br />
That's Shakespeare, his Shakespeare, he worships him so.<br />
Our Dick he writes poems, though none will he show;<br />
I found out his secret, but I won't tell: no, no.<br />
<br />
And when he's a great man, a poet you see,<br />
O dear! what a proud little sister I'll be;<br />
Hark! there comes the carriage. We're off, Dick and me.<br />
</div>


<h3><br />GRANDPAPA</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">Grandpapa</span> lives at the end of the lane,<br />
His cottage is small and its furniture plain;<br />
No pony to ride on, no equipage grand,&mdash;<br />
A garden, and just half an acre of land;<br />
No dainties to dine off, and very few toys,&mdash;<br />
Yet is grandpapa's house the delight of the boys.<br />
<br />
Grandpapa once lived in one little room,<br />
Grandpapa worked all day long at his loom:<br />
He speaks with queer accent, does dear grandpapa,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>And not half so well as papa and mamma.<br />
The girls think his clothes are a little rough,<br />
But the boys all declare they can't love him enough.<br />
<br />
A man of the people in manners and mind,<br />
Yet so honest, so tender, so clever, so kind:<br />
Makes the best of his lot still, where'er it be cast.<br />
A sturdy old Englishman, game to the last.<br />
Though simple and humble and unknown to fame,<br />
It's good luck to the boys to bear grandpapa's name!<br />

<h3><br />MONSIEUR ET MADEMOISELLE.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Deux</span> petits enfants Francais,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Monsieur et Mademoiselle.</span><br />
Of what can they be talking, child?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Indeed I cannot tell.</span><br />
But of this I am very certain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You would find naught to blame</span><br />
In that sweet French politeness&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wish we had the same.</span><br />
<br />
Monsieur has got a melon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scoops it with his knife,</span><br />
While Mademoiselle sits watching him:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">No rudeness here&mdash;no strife:</span><br />
Though could you listen only,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They're chattering like two pies&mdash;</span><br />
French magpies, understand me&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So merry and so wise.</span><br />
<br />
Their floor is bare of carpet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their curtains are so thin,</span><br />
They dine on meagre <i>potage</i>, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put many an onion in!</span><br />
Her snow-white caps she irons:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He blacks his shoes, he can;</span><br />
Yet she's a little lady<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he's a gentleman.</span><br />
<br />
O busy, happy children!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That light French heart of yours,</span><br />
Would it might sometimes enter at<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our solemn English doors!</span><br />
Would that we worked as gaily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And played, yes, played as well,</span><br />
And lived our lives as simply<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Monsieur et Mademoiselle.</span><br />

<h3><br />YOUNG DANDELION</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Young</span> Dandelion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a hedge-side,</span><br />
Said young Dandelion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who'll be my bride?</span><br />
<br />
"I'm a bold fellow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As ever was seen,</span><br />
With my shield of yellow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the grass green.</span><br />
<br />
"You may uproot me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From field and from lane,</span><br />
Trample me, cut me,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I spring up again.</span><br />
<br />
"I never flinch, Sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherever I dwell;</span><br />
Give me an inch, Sir.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll soon take an ell.</span><br />
<br />
"Drive me from garden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In anger and pride,</span><br />
I'll thrive and harden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the road-side.</span><br />
<br />
"Not a bit fearful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Showing my face,</span><br />
Always so cheerful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In every place."</span><br />
<br />
Said young Dandelion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a sweet air,</span><br />
"I have my eye on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Miss Daisy fair.</span><br />
<br />
"Though we may tarry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till past the cold,</span><br />
Her I will marry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere I grow old.</span><br />
<br />
"I will protect her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From all kinds of harm,</span><br />
Feed her with nectar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shelter her warm.</span><br />
<br />
"Whate'er the weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let it go by;</span><br />
We'll hold together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Daisy and I.</span><br />
<br />
"I'll ne'er give in,&mdash;no!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nothing I fear:</span><br />
All that I win, O!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll keep for my dear."</span><br />
<br />
Said young Dandelion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On his hedge-side,</span><br />
"Who'll me rely on?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who'll be my bride?"</span><br />

<h3><br />A SEPTEMBER ROBIN</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">My</span> eyes are full, my silent heart is stirred,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Amid these days so bright</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of ceaseless warmth and light;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Summer that will not die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Autumn, without one sigh</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">O'er sweet hours passing by&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Cometh that tender note</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Out of thy tiny throat,</span><br />
Like grief, or love, insisting to be heard,<br />
O little plaintive bird!<br />
<br />
No need of word<br />
Well know I all your tale&mdash;forgotten bird!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Soon you and I together</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Must face the winter weather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Remembering how we sung</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Our primrose fields among,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In days when life was young;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now, all is growing old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the warm earth's a-cold,</span><br />
Still, with brave heart we'll sing on, little bird,<br />
Sing only. Not one word.<br />
